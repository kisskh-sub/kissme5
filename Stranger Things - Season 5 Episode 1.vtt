{\an8}Should I stay or should I go now?

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:34.117
Should I stay or should I go now?

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.580
If I go, there will be trouble

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:42.083
And if I stay, it will be double

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:49.174
So, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.522
At long last,

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.192
we can begin.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:23.846
You and I,

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:31.562
we are going to do
such beautiful things together, William.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.609
Such beautiful things.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.042
Holly.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.211
Holly!

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:20.837
Holly!

00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:22.506
I've been calling you.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:23.673
I'm sorry.

00:06:23.674 --> 00:06:25.259
Could you round up the troops?

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:29.971
Breakfast!

00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:31.516
Coming!

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.393
{\an8}Nance, come on.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.230
{\an8}Let me in,
or I'm gonna whiz on the floor right here.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.731
{\an8}Sorry, Mrs. Byers.

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:41.109
{\an8}Whiz away.

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:42.944
{\an8}Wow.

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:46.030
{\an8}Shit.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:48.908
{\an8}Breakfast!

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:52.411
{\an8}Shit, dude, we overslept.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.081
{\an8}- I thought you were setting an alarm.
- I thought you were.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:04.673
- It's not always Jonathan's fault.
- It's always Jonathan's...

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.843
It wasn't my fault. I told you...

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.762
{\an8}Holly, can you pass the bacon?

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.348
Holly! Bacon!

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.936
- You need to just drop it.
- Whatever you want.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:20.231
You don't need it. You're crazy, huh?

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:24.777
Karen, do you have any Midol upstairs?

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.032
{\an8}Nancy, dishes in the sink.

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:34.411
{\an8}Be back at 5:00 or 6:00. Let me know
if you need me to pick up anything.

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:35.871
{\an8}- Boogie!
- Come on. Hurry up.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.789
{\an8}- I'm coming.
- Holly, your jacket.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.458
{\an8}- Here. Don't forget it.
- Thank you.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.417
{\an8}Hug.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:41.334
{\an8}- Bye.
- Bye.

00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:44.087
I'm sorry. I can't help clean up.
I'm running late.

00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:46.799
{\an8}It's okay, Joyce, really. I understand.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.218
{\an8}How much longer?

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.723
{\an8}What do you want me to do, Ted, huh?
Kick 'em to the street?

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:55.892
{\an8}Is that an option?

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:03.565
Hey, wait up! Wait up!

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.109
Come on, we gotta go!

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:11.990
The Morning Squawk, Mike,
we're gonna miss it!

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.912
Good morning, Hawkins!
This is WSQK The Squawk!

00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:17.579
That's a new one.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.748
It's looking like a regular day
in Hawkins.

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.000
Fifty-five degrees, low chance of rain,

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:25.712
medium chance of arrest,
high chance of helicopters.

00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:29.591
But general banality aside,
it's an exciting day for me,

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.260
your friend, entertainer, and DJ,
Robin Buckley...

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.222
Nice to meet you! ...AKA Rockin' Robin.

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.557
{\an8}And why is it a big day for me, you ask?

00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:40.227
Well, it's my 500th broadcast.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:43.647
Yeah, you heard that right, folks.
Five-double-O!

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.232
Which means it's been even longer

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:48.151
since you've heard the sultry voice
of Jimmy "Fast Hands" Lee.

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:53.073
But while Jimmy was fleeing Hawkins
even faster than he moves those hands,

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:57.244
yours truly was watching slack-jawed
as the earth split open beneath her feet

00:08:57.245 --> 00:09:00.455
and coughed up that tsunami
of mysterious dandruff.

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:04.501
And now, I'm stuck here with you,
my fellow quarantine compatriots.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:08.505
And if I can be brutally honest,
I couldn't be happier.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:13.593
Because when you really think about it,
why would you want to live anywhere else?

00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:16.263
I mean, what town on Earth can match

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:20.059
our very impressive
military-to-civilian ratio?

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:24.312
And those free,
mandatory medical checkups?

00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:25.814
I mean, very cool.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.191
'Cause after we inhaled
those springtime snowflakes,

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:29.526
who knows what's wrong with us?

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:32.237
{\an8}Maybe we're fine, maybe not.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.738
No one knows for sure.

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:39.036
After all, this was a "natural phenomenon
never before seen by man."

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.125
A phenomenon now covered up
by a giant metal Band-Aid.

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:48.712
Quite the eyesore,
but hey, great for sledding.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:53.091
Though seriously, kids, stop sledding
on the giant steel Band-Aid.

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.635
You are going to kill yourselves.
Also, the men with guns.

00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:58.973
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- They don't like it, not one bit.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.892
While we're on the subject
of things not to do,

00:10:02.893 --> 00:10:06.313
please steer clear
of the Military Access Control Zone,

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:10.568
aka the MAC-Z,
or as I like to call it, the Big Mac.

00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:13.361
I have no idea what's going on in there,

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:15.488
but I have a gut feeling

00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:19.659
there's a pretty good reason
they'd like you to stay away.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.038
But hey, the rest of Hawkins
is still there for you to enjoy.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.540
Someday soon,
they're gonna let us out of here.

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:27.459
In the meantime,
be thankful this is your home,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.046
study for that test,
enjoy that TV dinner, and go on that date.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:35.425
Which, by the way, is exactly
what yours truly is doing tonight.

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:39.013
That's right. Rockin' Robin has a date,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.267
And now, who is this lucky someone?

00:10:44.268 --> 00:10:46.646
Well, don't be so nosy, kids.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.064
They know who they are.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:53.318
That is, if you're listening,
which I hope you are.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:56.906
Because this next one, it's for you, babe.

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:06.165
What the hell?

00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:12.922
Whoa. What's going on?
What the hell? What the hell?

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.050
I told you to stop thumbing your nose
at the military.

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:20.387
I was reiterating their goddamn rules,
encouraging compliance.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:23.139
- Right. No sarcasm there.
- Said the dingus with the rubber chicken.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.311
- These are very serious people, Robin.
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:32.065
Henderson, you copy? Henderson?

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.526
Yeah, I copy.

00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:37.028
God, you sound swell.
Let me take a wild guess.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:38.905
You're not calling
to wish me good morning.

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:42.325
It's not exactly a good morning.
We've got a situation at the Squawk.

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:44.494
The signal, it's... it's gone all wonky.

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:46.371
I think Robin finally pissed 'em off.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.623
Doubtful. She was encouraging compliance.

00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:49.708
Told you!

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.918
The remote radio head's
the more likely culprit.

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.087
- The remote what?
- Just read the manual, Steve.

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.839
That thing might as well be in Greek.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.798
Then learn Greek!

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:59.677
I can't always be there
to solve your problems for you, Steve.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.470
Henderson?

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.098
God!

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.642
"Learn Greek." You heard that tone.

00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:09.103
You heard that, right?

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:19.822
Watch it.

00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:29.832
What'd I tell you about that shirt, freak?

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:33.586
Andy asked you a question, freak.
You deaf or what?

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.631
For his sake, I hope he is,
because I thought I was pretty damn clear

00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:40.675
when I said
I didn't wanna see you in that shirt.

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:42.385
You also told me
to stop screwing your mom,

00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:43.929
and that didn't stop me, did it?

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.476
- Something funny, Henderson?
- Let go.

00:12:48.976 --> 00:12:50.810
Hellfire is over, you hear me?

00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:52.604
Let go.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.940
Or what? What are you gonna do?

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:58.443
Stop! Andy! Stop!

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.403
Hey!

00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:06.744
Well, well.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:08.996
If it isn't the traitor.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.752
Remember that time
my sister kicked your balls so hard,

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.213
you limped for a week?

00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:19.924
Yeah, if you touch Dustin again,

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:23.009
I'll kick 'em so hard
they'll pop like water balloons.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.636
I say kick away.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.262
Stop this meathead from reproducing

00:13:26.263 --> 00:13:29.308
and further infecting the world
with his unique brand of idiocy.

00:13:34.563 --> 00:13:38.359
Hope you brought a change of clothes.
No one wants to see that shit.

00:13:49.453 --> 00:13:51.246
You've gotta stop provoking them, man.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.122
Oh, so this is my fault?

00:13:53.123 --> 00:13:56.084
- For what? Wearing a T-shirt?
- You know it's more than a T-shirt.

00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:58.044
I can't be like you
and turn the other cheek

00:13:58.045 --> 00:14:00.880
while they spread their bullshit
about Hellfire, about Eddie.

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:02.090
Eddie never gave a rat's ass

00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:04.467
about what those mouth breathers
were saying about him.

00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:07.220
What he would care about
is finding and killing Vecna.

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:11.349
Do you seriously think
I don't care about that, Mike? Really?

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.935
I think you're fighting two battles.
You need to be fighting one.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:16.813
Mike's right, Dustin.
What if you get seriously hurt?

00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:18.189
You're drawing attention.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.776
Remember what Hop said.
We need to keep our heads down.

00:14:21.777 --> 00:14:24.612
- Follow the rules. Blend in.
- Stay focused on our next crawl.

00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:26.447
Do you even hear yourselves right now?

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:30.034
Blend in? Follow the rules?
That's not what we've ever done.

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:32.412
- Jesus Christ.
- We stay true to ourselves.

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:34.455
We're supposed to stay true
to our friends.

00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:37.584
We stand up for what's right,
no matter the cost.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:38.877
You're not listening to us.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.129
No, you're not.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.590
Dustin!

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.718
- Unbelievable.
- Let him go.

00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:16.831
Come on.

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:17.833
Move, move!

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.393
You're a fast little shit, huh?

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.276
It's not her.

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:47.029
Another goddamn burnout, sir.

00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:50.532
Get her out of here.

00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:56.246
Shit!

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:33.032
Twelve minutes, 33 seconds.

00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:34.326
It's a new record.

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:40.581
So? How are we feeling?

00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:41.542
Okay.

00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:43.042
Okay?

00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:45.962
Come on, that was 12:33!

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:47.422
It's four seconds too slow.

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:49.716
I lost one second on the climb,
two seconds at the log.

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:52.135
- Hey.
- I can make my bus jump sooner.

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:55.304
That'll save me two more seconds.
That gets me under 12:30.

00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:58.016
El, you have to take it easy on yourself.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.436
- You think Henry's going easy?
- You know what I think?

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.814
I think we still have
some more of that waffle mix.

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:09.736
And I think we should celebrate
this record time with a stack of those.

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:14.658
And then maybe we could watch
a Miami Vice marathon.

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:18.454
I can beat the time. Reset it.

00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:21.497
If you're tired,
you're gonna injure yourself.

00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:22.416
Reset it!

00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:42.936
Heads up!

00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:55.740
Hey, hey. How you doing?

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:59.786
Austin Millbarge, ID 4528-niner.

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:01.997
That's me.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.099
I swear to God,
this stupid thing does not exist.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.518
- Can someone try Dustin again?
- He turned off his walkie.

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.645
- What's up with him lately?
- Don't get me started.

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:26.896
Yeah, please don't.

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:28.148
- Hey!
- Huh?

00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:30.025
Got it.

00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:37.198
Wait, wait, wait. There it is, yeah.

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.700
Remote radio head, yeah.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:44.039
And, uh, where exactly are we gonna find
this remote thingamajig?

00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:52.172
I don't see it.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.757
It's up there somewhere.

00:18:54.758 --> 00:18:55.926
It's gotta be.

00:18:56.468 --> 00:19:01.557
So, I guess somebody's gotta climb
to the tippy top of this bad boy and...

00:19:03.058 --> 00:19:06.353
Without a harness or anything,
it seems kind of dangerous.

00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:10.064
AKA job for good old Steve Harrington.

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.983
- No third person, please.
- All right.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.442
I, uh...

00:19:13.443 --> 00:19:16.738
I actually think this might be
a better job for Jonathan Byers.

00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:21.201
I'm like one quarter monkey, dude.
I got this, Byers. Don't sweat it.

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.204
Uh, voltage!

00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:26.914
Unless you wanna fry.

00:19:26.915 --> 00:19:28.000
Yeah, I know.

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:30.294
I'm not an idiot.

00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:44.391
Whoa, dude, what are you doing?

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:47.351
I got this, dude. Don't sweat it.

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:48.812
Son of a...

00:20:00.073 --> 00:20:03.577
What is it about your presence
that brings out their inner Neanderthal?

00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:08.582
I thought grocery delivery
wasn't till tomorrow.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:10.417
Me too.

00:20:13.837 --> 00:20:15.631
Ah, come on. Come on.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:36.777
Shit.

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:41.823
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:48.622
Found ya.

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:54.461
Never fails.

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.297
- I fixed it!
- I fixed it!

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:07.599
All right.

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.771
Santa's brought a full sack today.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:20.404
A fresh telemetry tag.
Scarcer than hen's teeth, these things.

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:26.242
Enough bullets and shells
for Hop to start a small war,

00:21:26.243 --> 00:21:28.537
if he should so choose.

00:21:29.496 --> 00:21:31.415
Anyone order a salad?

00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:34.125
Grenade salad?

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:37.462
I hid the grenades under the, uh, lettuce.

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:39.256
Okay.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.466
Gatorade for El's battery.

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:43.802
Did someone say Gatorade?

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.262
- Let me get one. Thanks.
- Sure.

00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:49.016
But I don't think
it's gonna go too well with...

00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:51.809
peanut butter!

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.603
Boppers! God, I missed these things.

00:21:54.604 --> 00:21:55.646
Thanks.

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:57.899
Don't worry, Mr. Byers.
I got you a present too.

00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:00.401
I know you're allergic to jazz,

00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:04.364
but just give it a whirl.
I think you'll find it quite engaging.

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:10.954
And for the station manager,
the reason for my premature delivery.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.170
A burn? Tonight? But that's--

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:20.296
Too soon, I know.

00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:24.925
Whatever they're doing in the Upside Down
evidently needs serious resources.

00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:26.469
That's a lot of cargo.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:31.015
I figure a supply drop this big
takes two hours, minimum.

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:33.559
Which gives Hopper
plenty of time for a crawl.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.982
Maybe tonight's the night
we finally find that bastard and end this.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.013
Hey there, Jake.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.308
You up for a little field trip?

00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:19.271
I'm telling you, he's lost his mind.

00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:21.565
He told me
he wanted to start Hellfire again.

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:23.318
What? When did he say that?

00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:27.154
This weekend. He was talking
about finding the lost sheep.

00:23:27.155 --> 00:23:29.116
And we thought the shirt was bad.

00:23:29.616 --> 00:23:31.827
I'm telling you, he's lost his damn mind.

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:34.328
Who's lost his damn mind?

00:23:34.329 --> 00:23:36.622
- Uh, the--
- Andy!

00:23:36.623 --> 00:23:37.581
- Andy!
- Andy.

00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:39.125
- Andy lost his mind.
- Yeah.

00:23:39.126 --> 00:23:40.960
Like when he came at you this morning.

00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:42.628
- Yeah, that was--
- Messed up.

00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:43.630
Yeah.

00:23:44.172 --> 00:23:45.340
It's rude.

00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:51.429
Hey there, friends, this is Rockin' Robin.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.223
Sorry about the abrupt departure.
I hope you survived without me.

00:23:54.224 --> 00:23:57.352
We had some annoying
technical difficulties.

00:23:59.729 --> 00:24:02.106
But to make it up to you,
we have a very special treat

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:05.360
that's sure to turn your day upside down...

00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:08.320
- Holy shit.
- Already?

00:24:08.321 --> 00:24:09.489
Paper! Give me paper!

00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:12.992
Come on! Will, hurry up!

00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:15.619
You're giving love instinctively

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.373
Before you start bumping,
here's a few fun facts about the Boss.

00:24:19.374 --> 00:24:22.377
She was born Diane
in the North End of Detroit.

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:26.672
Berry Gordy, that's Gordy with a G,
signed her to Motown in 1961.

00:24:26.673 --> 00:24:28.674
And one is the key number,

00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:30.676
because between 1964 and '67,

00:24:30.677 --> 00:24:33.429
the Supremes had ten songs
hit the top of the charts.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:34.972
That's right, ten.

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:38.142
Then in '78, she tried to make it big
in the movies with The Wiz,

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:40.352
which was a colossal flop-a-roonie.

00:24:40.353 --> 00:24:43.147
But, in my personal opinion,
I still dig it.

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:44.982
Michael Jackson as a scarecrow?

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.442
Give it a chance.

00:24:46.443 --> 00:24:48.444
But make sure you bring
your super-sized popcorn,

00:24:48.445 --> 00:24:51.989
because this movie has a run time
of over two hours.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.741
All right, class dismissed.

00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:56.702
I hope you were taking notes.
There will be a test later.

00:24:56.703 --> 00:24:57.787
Take it away, Diane.

00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:00.999
Upside down

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.209
Crawl tonight.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.293
Come on.

00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:05.754
Inside out

00:25:06.546 --> 00:25:08.088
'Round and 'round

00:25:08.089 --> 00:25:10.175
Upside down

00:25:10.967 --> 00:25:14.512
Boy, you turn me inside out

00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:16.806
And 'round and 'round

00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:20.392
I know you got charm and appeal

00:25:20.393 --> 00:25:22.061
You always play the field

00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:25.273
I'm crazy to think you're all mine

00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:30.444
As long as the sun continues to shine

00:25:30.445 --> 00:25:33.657
There's a place in my heart for you
That's the bottom line

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:55.678
All right.

00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:58.764
So, assuming Murray's intel is correct,

00:25:58.765 --> 00:26:02.309
the supply convoy is set
to reach Hawkins at 10:00 sharp.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.728
Meaning I want Hopper in the tunnels

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:07.523
and en route to MAC-Z no later than 9:00.

00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:09.818
Lucas, we'll take
our usual observation post.

00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:11.819
Barring unusual traffic,

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.405
I expect the convoy
to reach MAC-Z at 10:15.

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:16.448
Once the burn starts
and there's sufficient cover,

00:26:16.449 --> 00:26:18.159
we'll signal Hopper, who'll make his move.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.245
And now the crawl begins.

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.622
Hop is now in the Upside Down,

00:26:23.623 --> 00:26:26.750
traveling at what I hope to be
a gentle 30 miles an hour,

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:27.668
which will allow...

00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:30.045
...you and Harrington to follow along
in the Rightside Up.

00:26:30.046 --> 00:26:32.673
Just remember,
try and keep the telemetry signal within...

00:26:32.674 --> 00:26:35.801
Negative 60 and negative 70 dB.
Easy-peasy.

00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:38.387
I expect the convoy
to take the same route as last month.

00:26:38.388 --> 00:26:40.556
Main to Cornwallis, one turn.

00:26:40.557 --> 00:26:42.349
But if you guys hit any red lights...

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.602
- I'll blow through.
- Only if there's no MPs around.

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:48.731
Remember, if you guys get pulled over,
we lose Hop, we're toast.

00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:49.898
I got it.

00:26:49.899 --> 00:26:53.111
You're gonna travel up Cornwallis
for about six miles.

00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:56.155
And as the convoy reaches
this Shell station here...

00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:57.865
We radio Hop to disembark.

00:26:57.866 --> 00:27:00.117
Which will drop the old man
at the border of G1.

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:05.539
Where he'll have two whole hours
to search for Vecna, which is ample time.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.875
He's cleared zones much faster.

00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:12.547
So, all in all,
signs point to another successful crawl.

00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:15.884
Is there a problem?

00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:18.136
Um...

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.057
No. No, I mean, I think it's good.

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:25.017
Yeah, yeah, it's good. It's really good.

00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:26.101
It's just, um...

00:27:26.102 --> 00:27:30.105
Zone G1 is not that exciting or Vecna-y.

00:27:30.106 --> 00:27:32.983
What does it have?
A Circuit City, a couple of houses, and a...

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:37.071
Big Buy? What are the chances
Vecna's shopping for Lucky Charms?

00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:38.906
It doesn't matter. We stick to the plan.

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:41.784
We break into the Upside Down
the only way we can,

00:27:41.785 --> 00:27:44.119
through the MAC-Z gate,
under the cover of a burn.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.081
Once inside, we search
one zone at a time, methodically,

00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:49.084
until we figure out
where he's been hiding.

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:50.669
Unless...

00:27:51.753 --> 00:27:53.088
he's already dead.

00:27:53.588 --> 00:27:55.423
Again, your plan is great. It's just...

00:27:56.132 --> 00:27:58.342
This is crawl what? Are we in the 30s now?

00:27:58.343 --> 00:27:59.928
And not a single baddie in sight?

00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:02.137
El can't find him in her bath,

00:28:02.138 --> 00:28:04.807
and Will hasn't had his goosies
since the shake 'n' quake.

00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:06.642
- Goosies?
- And last we saw Vecna,

00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:08.852
he was roasting like a turkey
and pumped full of lead.

00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:10.604
That was before he fell three stories.

00:28:10.605 --> 00:28:12.981
So you ever think
we're scouring a battlefield

00:28:12.982 --> 00:28:15.734
that we already, like, won?

00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:18.862
Have you forgotten what he showed Nancy?
Hawkins on fire.

00:28:18.863 --> 00:28:21.198
- Karen, Holly, everyone dead.
- Yeah, man.

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:24.451
He also showed Max her brother
walking around with a hole in his chest.

00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:27.037
That's what he does. He gets in your head
and tries to scare you.

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:30.791
He did a good job because I am scared.
And you should be scared too.

00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:34.044
Because if he's still out there,
he's planning to end our world, so...

00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:37.673
We don't stop looking.
Even if it takes 100 more crawls, 1,000.

00:28:37.674 --> 00:28:39.633
We don't stop until we're goddamn sure

00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:44.681
that wrinkled, noseless, rotting bastard
is dead and gone and never coming back.

00:28:46.141 --> 00:28:47.183
Everyone in?

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:57.402
I want to see Vecna's heart on a platter.

00:28:58.236 --> 00:28:59.654
Just wish I could do it myself.

00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:01.905
For Eddie.

00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:03.198
- For Eddie.
- For Eddie.

00:29:03.199 --> 00:29:06.493
On three, "kill Vecna." One, two, three.

00:29:06.494 --> 00:29:07.579
Kill Vecna!

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.124
Oh no!

00:29:12.625 --> 00:29:16.295
- Military man.
- Wanted to see if you had my back.

00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:19.466
Yeah, I have your back.

00:29:54.709 --> 00:29:55.959
- Will!
- Will!

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.045
Will!

00:29:57.545 --> 00:29:59.963
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, it's okay. I'm fine.

00:29:59.964 --> 00:30:01.799
Was it him? Was it Vecna?

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.051
I don't know.
I just had this crazy feeling,

00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:06.346
and then the sky was spinning, and...

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.058
I don't know.
I guess maybe it's nothing, right?

00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:12.685
I don't know.

00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:16.313
Maybe I just get nervous sometimes
before crawls.

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:18.191
Yeah, I... I get nervous too.

00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:20.902
But the sky doesn't spin for me.

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.779
It ever spin for you?

00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:24.906
Maybe he's close.

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:31.662
Okay. Squawk, six o'clock,
not a second later, right?

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:32.830
- Six o'clock.
- Are you okay?

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:33.831
- Yeah.
- You sure?

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:35.792
- Take it slow.
- Okay, yeah.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.594
I'm just trying to get it started.
Ready? Here we go. Come on.

00:30:47.595 --> 00:30:51.348
I just gotta get this going,
and then we're gonna have lots of fun.

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:53.058
Blast off!

00:30:53.059 --> 00:30:54.685
Derek, stop! Come on! Get off!

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:56.603
- Derek, stop!
- Hold on tight!

00:30:56.604 --> 00:30:59.147
- Go away! Derek!
- Try not to puke!

00:30:59.148 --> 00:31:00.316
Stop!

00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:03.318
- Jerk face!
- Bite me.

00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:04.737
You okay? Come here.

00:31:05.572 --> 00:31:06.613
Let's get you off.

00:31:06.614 --> 00:31:08.574
Oh my... Careful, careful!

00:31:08.575 --> 00:31:10.034
You okay?

00:31:10.743 --> 00:31:12.871
All right, my dears, playtime's over.

00:31:14.163 --> 00:31:14.998
Come on.

00:31:15.832 --> 00:31:17.916
What is with that grumpy face?

00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:23.965
Come on, we have books to read,
art to create, wisdom to unlock.

00:31:27.343 --> 00:31:28.344
Holly?

00:31:31.973 --> 00:31:32.932
Hi.

00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:36.852
And she can tell Derek to go away too.

00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:38.980
He is a jerk face.

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.983
Oh yeah, Miss Harris gave me...

00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:48.031
But she also said
it wasn't really my fault.

00:32:19.687 --> 00:32:23.398
Are you just
going to stand there, Sergeant Ramirez,

00:32:23.399 --> 00:32:25.901
or did you have something to report?

00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:27.235
Sorry, Dr. Kay.

00:32:27.236 --> 00:32:29.613
Yes. Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan,

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:31.782
he tracked down
that lead we spoke about, and--

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:34.326
It was a tremendous success.

00:32:34.327 --> 00:32:36.078
No, unfortunately.

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:39.624
I see
they don't teach sarcasm in the ROTC.

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:46.129
If it was good news,
Sullivan would be here himself,

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.467
with trumpets and confetti,
I have no doubt.

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:53.429
Don't worry. It doesn't bite.

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:56.265
It does, on occasion, strangle.

00:32:58.351 --> 00:32:59.727
Was there anything else?

00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:03.563
A new lead, perhaps,
to offer more false hope?

00:33:03.564 --> 00:33:04.941
Not yet, Doctor.

00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:09.779
Sergeant.

00:33:11.614 --> 00:33:16.076
Please tell your commander
that I am running into a wall here.

00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:19.038
People are dying, innocent people.

00:33:20.707 --> 00:33:22.667
I need the girl.

00:33:49.402 --> 00:33:50.986
The last run, what was my time?

00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:55.282
I'm not sure. I didn't see.
I was distracted by Diana Ross.

00:33:55.283 --> 00:33:56.993
I saved four seconds.

00:33:57.493 --> 00:33:58.452
Highly doubt that.

00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:00.245
No, no, it was very fast.

00:34:00.246 --> 00:34:03.123
One second on the climb,
one with the log, two on the bus.

00:34:03.124 --> 00:34:05.333
Great. You did that today.
You can do it again tomorrow.

00:34:05.334 --> 00:34:09.212
The crawl is tonight, Hop.
If I'm under 12:30, I can come with you.

00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:12.758
- That is what you promised.
- Yeah, I promised that. I promised it.

00:34:12.759 --> 00:34:14.635
But I didn't see it.

00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:17.764
So blame Diana.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.446
You didn't think
I could make the time, did you?

00:34:34.447 --> 00:34:37.616
I think you can, but no, not today.
I don't think you made that time.

00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:39.201
Are you saying that I lie?

00:34:39.202 --> 00:34:41.036
No, I'm saying you're mistaken.

00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:42.621
I'm not mistaken.

00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:45.374
Okay, so you're on your sixth run,

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.793
you're totally drained,

00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:52.547
and you just happen to break
your second record of the day,

00:34:52.548 --> 00:34:54.216
right before a crawl.

00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:55.425
I don't think so, kid.

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:59.513
You saw the time. I saw you look down.
You have to let me go with you.

00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:01.515
You want to find Henry so bad, don't you?

00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:02.516
So bad.

00:35:02.517 --> 00:35:04.560
Do it. Do it from the tub.

00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:06.437
Do it remotely.

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.857
You're not coming with me. Not today.

00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:11.651
End of story.

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:26.457
Why are you being so hard on her?

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.584
I'm not being hard on her.

00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:32.170
She's just trying to help.

00:35:32.171 --> 00:35:33.713
It'd be great if Will could help,

00:35:33.714 --> 00:35:36.258
but you keep that kid
wrapped in bubble wrap.

00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:38.301
Come on. That's different.

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:39.761
I mean, El...

00:35:39.762 --> 00:35:43.057
Look at her. She's... She's ready.

00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:45.851
Thirty-seven crawls.

00:35:45.852 --> 00:35:49.187
The only thing I found
down in that damn place are soldiers,

00:35:49.188 --> 00:35:50.188
lots of them.

00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:52.608
And they're all looking
for one person, El.

00:35:53.192 --> 00:35:56.319
So there's no reason to put her life
on the line and bring her down there,

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.406
especially not for some recon mission.

00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:03.661
Well, if it's just some recon mission,
then what's with all the guns?

00:36:04.245 --> 00:36:05.954
It's in case I run into trouble.

00:36:05.955 --> 00:36:08.166
- Yeah, or in case you run into him.
- No.

00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:12.170
I run into that psychic freak,
I'm tucking tail and running.

00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:17.049
I'm nuts. I'm nuts. But I'm not that nuts.

00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:26.434
I'm gonna need El.
I know that. I know that.

00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:30.938
Which is precisely why
there's no point in risking her life

00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:34.192
over some stupid recon crap.

00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:41.282
I want her primed, but I want her safe.
Safe until the very last minute, okay?

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:44.535
Yeah, okay.

00:36:45.828 --> 00:36:49.290
But her time on that last run,

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:50.791
did she make it?

00:36:52.585 --> 00:36:54.128
With a second to spare.

00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:36.711
See what Donna was wearing?

00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:38.672
She's gone up like two sizes
since last year.

00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:40.883
- Yeah, right.
- Jesus Christ!

00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:43.010
Oh my God.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.515
It's just a corn snake, dude.
Guys, it's just a corn snake.

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:50.558
You're a pussy, dude.

00:37:50.559 --> 00:37:53.271
- Did you piss your pants?
- It's just a snake.

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:56.023
Hey, Andy, is that your new pet?

00:37:56.857 --> 00:37:57.858
Don't scare him.

00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:18.462
Holly!

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:20.881
Holly!

00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:30.850
Holly.

00:38:32.018 --> 00:38:34.561
What are you doing?
Come on. I have to get going.

00:38:34.562 --> 00:38:36.022
Sorry.

00:38:37.606 --> 00:38:39.066
They told me to wait.

00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:55.915
Is this about your mystery friend again?

00:38:55.916 --> 00:38:57.543
Mr. Whatsit?

00:39:00.087 --> 00:39:01.880
He's only trying to help.

00:39:01.881 --> 00:39:04.342
Help? How?

00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:06.509
By protecting me.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:10.931
He says that there are
monsters in Hawkins,

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:14.977
and... they like to eat kids like me.

00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:17.688
Monsters aren't real, Holly.

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:20.358
I don't believe you.

00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:25.196
I know you're scared
because of everything that's happened.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:30.033
With the crazy stories people tell,
I mean, I get scared sometimes too.

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.159
No, you don't.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.369
Are you kidding?

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.454
Everyone in Hawkins is scared shitless.

00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:36.289
Anyone who says they aren't
are full of it.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:39.584
Like that mouth breather in your class...
What's his name again?

00:39:39.585 --> 00:39:41.587
- Derek?
- Yeah, Derek.

00:39:42.296 --> 00:39:44.173
He probably wets his bed every night.

00:39:47.134 --> 00:39:49.053
Know who I turn to when I get scared?

00:39:58.896 --> 00:39:59.730
Mike the Brave.

00:40:00.314 --> 00:40:02.607
He goes on adventures
called dungeon crawls.

00:40:02.608 --> 00:40:04.275
What's a dungeon crawl?

00:40:04.276 --> 00:40:06.903
Basically, he explores
these underground worlds,

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:10.698
where he fights monsters,
evil wizards, sorcerers and stuff.

00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:13.326
But Mike the Brave is never scared.

00:40:13.327 --> 00:40:17.372
So whenever I'm feeling
frightened or nervous,

00:40:17.373 --> 00:40:19.332
I just imagine that he's at my side,

00:40:19.333 --> 00:40:20.418
and I feel better.

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:25.047
So maybe the next time you get scared,
you don't need this Mr. Whatsit.

00:40:25.714 --> 00:40:28.801
Maybe you just need Holly the Heroic.

00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:31.262
Holly the Heroic?

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.807
I was gonna to wait a few more years, but...

00:40:44.692 --> 00:40:47.777
She's a cleric,
which means she has divine powers.

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:50.363
She can cast spells of protection
to ward against evil spirits,

00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:53.741
and even cooler,
she can cast a dimension door,

00:40:53.742 --> 00:40:56.078
which can teleport you
to anywhere you visualize.

00:40:57.746 --> 00:40:58.705
I mean, come on.

00:40:58.706 --> 00:41:01.040
Can this lame-o Mr. Whatsit
do any of this?

00:41:01.041 --> 00:41:03.043
No.

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:07.965
She'll keep you safe. I promise.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.680
It was this weird feeling.

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:18.350
Like something
I really haven't felt before.

00:41:18.851 --> 00:41:21.978
Mike thinks it could mean
that maybe Vecna's close,

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:24.857
that he's finally re-emerged.

00:41:25.357 --> 00:41:29.028
And if he has,
maybe we'll find him tonight.

00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:33.616
What do you think, Lucas?

00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:38.913
Yeah, I think
we'll find him this time for sure.

00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:43.291
You wanna play the tape?

00:41:43.292 --> 00:41:45.877
I'm gonna go grab a Coke
or something caffeinated,

00:41:45.878 --> 00:41:48.129
because it's gonna be a long night.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.381
You want one?

00:41:49.882 --> 00:41:51.800
No. I'm good. Thanks.

00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:34.426
Robin!

00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:37.012
Rockin' Robin!

00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:44.477
Okay. So I have good news,
and I have bad news.

00:42:44.478 --> 00:42:45.770
What are you doing here?

00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:48.356
A good friend once said,
"Bad news first, always."

00:42:48.357 --> 00:42:50.818
So I have to cancel our date tonight.

00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:52.652
Of course.

00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:56.364
But the good news is
I made us a reservation.

00:42:56.365 --> 00:42:59.368
8:00 p.m. tomorrow night at Enzo's.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.331
Enzo's? Okay, how exactly
are we gonna be able to afford that?

00:43:05.332 --> 00:43:07.542
You mean how am I going to afford it?

00:43:07.543 --> 00:43:09.545
Because you, my dear,
are paying for nothing.

00:43:10.379 --> 00:43:11.379
Double how, then?

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.840
I stole money off the dead guy
they just wheeled out.

00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:15.675
That's not funny.
His name was Mr. Pentergast,

00:43:15.676 --> 00:43:16.718
and he was very nice.

00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:18.052
And very rich.

00:43:18.053 --> 00:43:21.848
- Robin...
- Look, dinner's on me, okay?

00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:26.644
But, uh, maybe for dessert,
I could... I could see you in this hat,

00:43:26.645 --> 00:43:29.023
and, like, only this hat.

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:32.484
I hate you. I...

00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:43.162
Was that on purpose?

00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:45.581
- Totally.
- That's so sexy.

00:43:47.082 --> 00:43:50.418
So, there any chance
I could get you to wear this outfit?

00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:51.462
But that's...

00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:03.265
Who is that?

00:44:03.766 --> 00:44:04.725
Shit.

00:44:28.957 --> 00:44:33.212
Don't worry, Eddie.
Eventually they'll get bored.

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:13.793
You should really keep a better eye
on your pets, Henderson.

00:45:13.794 --> 00:45:17.755
It's dangerous out there.
They shouldn't be left alone like that.

00:45:17.756 --> 00:45:20.550
Hey there, freak. Long time no see.

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:21.635
Hiya.

00:45:28.183 --> 00:45:31.519
Something funny, Henderson?

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.064
No, I... I was just thinking.

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:36.233
In Eddie's last campaign,

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:40.988
I defeated Vecna's lead acolyte
by casting Prismatic Spray.

00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:44.158
One D8 turned up a 7.

00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:45.784
Violet.

00:45:46.368 --> 00:45:48.704
Is that supposed to be English, freak?

00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:53.959
Well, violet Prismatic Spray
is the deadliest. You know why?

00:45:55.878 --> 00:45:57.463
It causes blindness.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:01.091
Hey!

00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:31.288
Hellfire dies with you, Henderson.

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:33.040
And it dies tonight.

00:46:46.845 --> 00:46:50.389
Dustin, this is Lucas. Do you copy? Over.

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:53.060
Dustin, do you copy? Over.

00:46:54.186 --> 00:46:57.396
Dustin, you're an hour late, man.
You're making us nervous.

00:46:57.397 --> 00:46:59.191
We need you here at the Squawk.

00:46:59.733 --> 00:47:02.443
Dustin, if you can hear us,
please respond. Over.

00:47:02.444 --> 00:47:04.862
I got off the phone with his mom.
She hasn't heard from him.

00:47:04.863 --> 00:47:07.615
- Christ, Henderson.
- He'll show. He always shows.

00:47:07.616 --> 00:47:08.617
Try him again.

00:47:09.117 --> 00:47:11.744
Come in, Dustin. Are you there?
Earth to Dustin.

00:47:11.745 --> 00:47:13.997
This is serious, man. Quit playing.
We can't wait around.

00:47:17.584 --> 00:47:19.335
Get your ass to the Squawk.

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:21.546
We can't wait around.
We need you here now.

00:47:21.547 --> 00:47:23.298
This is not funny. Are you there?

00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:26.176
Dustin, is everything okay?

00:47:26.802 --> 00:47:29.680
- Do you think Dustin is okay?
- Dustin!

00:47:30.597 --> 00:47:31.598
I hope so.

00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:34.476
He was acting weird today.

00:47:35.394 --> 00:47:37.145
Weird how?

00:47:37.729 --> 00:47:42.150
Just angry, scared, reckless. Not himself.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.820
Hopper's the same.

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:46.697
Not himself.

00:47:49.783 --> 00:47:52.618
Maybe it's just getting to us, you know?

00:47:52.619 --> 00:47:56.831
Being... Being stuck in here,
not knowing where Vecna is,

00:47:56.832 --> 00:47:58.040
no end in sight.

00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:00.835
I mean, we're really starting to lose it.

00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:03.797
I mean, we really need to catch a break.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.135
And maybe we will.
Because earlier, Will had a feeling.

00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:11.387
- If Will has a feeling--
- Then it means something.

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:13.639
So... So, maybe tonight's our break.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.142
Maybe even our last crawl.

00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:18.854
We find Vecna,
and we end this once and for all.

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:23.900
And then what happens?

00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:26.904
You mean after you totally demolish Vecna?

00:48:28.363 --> 00:48:32.284
In my campaigns, if the party wins,
then they all live happily ever after.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.953
Happily how?

00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:40.791
Well, usually what happens is the party
doesn't return to their local village,

00:48:40.792 --> 00:48:42.753
because too much has happened.

00:48:43.503 --> 00:48:44.879
They've seen too much.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.215
So they travel to a faraway land,
a... a peaceful land,

00:48:48.216 --> 00:48:52.137
somewhere beautiful,
with like three waterfalls or something,

00:48:52.846 --> 00:48:55.557
and they all start again, together.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.188
Do you think that could be real for us?

00:49:01.813 --> 00:49:03.690
Yeah, of course.

00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:09.821
I mean, not the three waterfalls part.
But the other stuff, yeah, of course.

00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:14.451
If Vecna's gone, then what's stopping us?

00:49:16.745 --> 00:49:19.372
Hey, lovebirds! Chief's almost ready.

00:49:19.373 --> 00:49:21.625
Let's do this. Come on.

00:49:35.514 --> 00:49:36.515
Thank you.

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:40.643
Here.

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:41.728
Good luck.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.440
- Tag's active.
- Copy.

00:49:47.734 --> 00:49:50.028
Harrington, you getting any signal?
Tag is active.

00:49:51.238 --> 00:49:52.698
Yeah, just give me a second.

00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:04.042
Hey, anybody know
how Henderson's wheelie thing works?

00:50:04.918 --> 00:50:05.918
Uh, any ideas?

00:50:05.919 --> 00:50:08.838
There's a safety lock.
Look for a small switch under the wheel.

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:11.716
There should be
a safety lock under the wheel.

00:50:11.717 --> 00:50:14.261
Safety lock, real necessary.

00:50:24.312 --> 00:50:25.313
Okay.

00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:30.986
Okay, getting a signal.

00:50:31.486 --> 00:50:33.238
It's pretty quiet, though.

00:50:42.914 --> 00:50:45.499
Okay, signal's holding a steady 90 dB.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:49.171
But how am I supposed to monitor this
and drive without Henderson?

00:50:49.755 --> 00:50:52.089
Uh, hear anything from Inspector Gadget?

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:53.174
Nothing.

00:50:53.175 --> 00:50:55.468
I can do it. I... I can monitor.

00:50:55.469 --> 00:50:56.844
No. You're staying here.

00:50:56.845 --> 00:50:59.597
Mom, I helped Dustin set up the antenna.
I know how to work it.

00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:02.183
Out of the question.
It... It's just a wheel.

00:51:02.184 --> 00:51:03.392
It's not just a wheel.

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:05.395
Jonathan, you... you can work it, right?

00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:09.982
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think so.

00:51:09.983 --> 00:51:12.276
You better not think. You better know.

00:51:12.277 --> 00:51:14.154
You lose me out there,
I'm not coming home.

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.989
I can handle it.

00:51:32.339 --> 00:51:34.299
You comfortable back there, Byers?

00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:37.219
Or you want me to get you a pillow?

00:51:38.136 --> 00:51:39.721
Just focus on driving.

00:52:05.205 --> 00:52:07.833
Try to get back to me in one piece, okay?

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.256
What?

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.424
Sorry, I'm just looking at you.

00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:18.552
You get more beautiful every day.

00:52:21.388 --> 00:52:22.681
How is that fair?

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:25.182
You didn't answer my question.

00:52:25.183 --> 00:52:26.476
I know.

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:28.728
You didn't answer mine.

00:53:06.099 --> 00:53:10.728
Look, she was standing
at the fence, talking into thin air.

00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:12.479
She probably was talking to herself.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.231
...standing there talking to nobody.

00:53:14.232 --> 00:53:18.277
Well, she's hardly the first child
to have an imaginary friend, Karen.

00:53:18.278 --> 00:53:20.654
I wouldn't be so worried
if she was five years old,

00:53:20.655 --> 00:53:22.198
but she's not five anymore, is she?

00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:25.284
In fact, do you even know
how old your daughter is?

00:53:25.285 --> 00:53:27.661
- Oh, you don't even know how old she is!
- You're ridiculous.

00:53:27.662 --> 00:53:29.788
I'm not talking to you
when you're like this.

00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:32.124
First one tonight,
or already onto number two?

00:53:32.125 --> 00:53:33.585
Does it matter?

00:54:53.581 --> 00:54:56.583
Squawk to Crow's Nest, anything? Over.

00:54:56.584 --> 00:54:58.545
Negative, not a peep.

00:55:05.176 --> 00:55:06.428
Do you have to chew so loud?

00:55:07.012 --> 00:55:08.387
Snipers chew gum.

00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:09.806
You're not a sniper.

00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:15.645
Package incoming.
Four trucks, outer east gate on Main.

00:55:16.271 --> 00:55:20.025
We got action.
Four trucks, outer east gate on Main.

00:55:27.073 --> 00:55:28.366
The hole! Clear the hole.

00:55:30.118 --> 00:55:32.119
Burners, prepare to deploy.

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.622
On my mark! Move, move, move.

00:55:35.623 --> 00:55:37.167
Burners heading for the gate.

00:55:40.587 --> 00:55:43.757
Burn commencing in five, four,

00:55:44.466 --> 00:55:47.177
three, two,

00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:49.220
and boom!

00:56:05.904 --> 00:56:08.573
Trucks moving in.

00:56:27.425 --> 00:56:28.426
Am I clear?

00:56:31.096 --> 00:56:33.348
- Clear to the east.
- East is clear.

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.100
And to the west?

00:56:38.311 --> 00:56:40.188
Hold. We got a straggler.

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:41.814
Come on.

00:56:41.815 --> 00:56:43.482
Get the hell out of there.

00:56:43.483 --> 00:56:44.567
Come on.

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:50.323
Clear.

00:57:01.835 --> 00:57:04.170
He's in.

00:57:16.641 --> 00:57:18.184
Open sesame.

00:57:38.746 --> 00:57:40.039
He's flipped.

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:50.133
Jonathan, signal?

00:57:57.474 --> 00:57:58.308
Snagged it.

00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:02.020
- Should I move?
- No.

00:58:02.604 --> 00:58:03.521
Hold.

00:58:04.689 --> 00:58:06.941
Hold. Hold.

00:58:08.401 --> 00:58:09.861
Hold.

00:58:10.445 --> 00:58:11.279
Go!

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:20.038
Van is on the move.

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:30.714
Hopper, can you hear us okay?

00:58:30.715 --> 00:58:32.592
Yeah, yeah, loud and clear.

00:58:33.259 --> 00:58:35.594
Good, good. Okay, hard part's over.

00:58:35.595 --> 00:58:39.098
I mean, speak for yourself.
I still gotta jump out of this thing.

00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:42.309
And is it me,
or are we moving faster than normal?

00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:43.435
A little faster.

00:58:43.436 --> 00:58:46.230
Just aim for the grass.

00:58:46.231 --> 00:58:49.359
I was gonna go for the asphalt,
but now that you mention the grass--

00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:58.743
What's going on? Hopper?

00:58:59.452 --> 00:59:00.869
- We're losing him!
- Wait, what?

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:02.372
Wait! Stop! Stop!

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:14.509
We got him.

00:59:17.595 --> 00:59:19.097
{\an8}Hopper, do you copy?

00:59:19.681 --> 00:59:20.598
Hopper!

00:59:21.474 --> 00:59:23.058
Yeah, I copy.

00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:24.726
What the hell happened?

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:27.604
I don't know. We just slammed to a stop.

00:59:27.605 --> 00:59:29.732
Wh... Why would they stop?

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.526
The soldiers...

00:59:32.902 --> 00:59:34.195
they know he's there.

00:59:35.488 --> 00:59:36.781
We don't know that.

00:59:43.663 --> 00:59:45.623
What's going on over there?

00:59:49.961 --> 00:59:51.087
There are too many.

00:59:51.796 --> 00:59:53.214
He can't take them.

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:13.693
Whoa!

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.925
- The hell's happening?
- I don't know.

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:27.808
Will! No!

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:28.850
Honey!

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:32.522
Will! Will! Will!

01:02:12.353 --> 01:02:13.771
Squawk, do you copy?

01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:16.607
Joyce? Anyone?

01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:39.629
Will, Will, come back! Come on, honey.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:42.215
Will, come back. Come back.

01:02:42.216 --> 01:02:43.467
Will, come on.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.553
Will! Will! Wake up!

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:04.739
Come back! Come back!

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.240
Will, sweetie. It's okay.

01:03:07.241 --> 01:03:08.784
Mom!

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:11.078
It's okay. It's okay.

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:13.997
I'm here. I'm here.

01:03:13.998 --> 01:03:16.626
It's okay. Just breathe. Just breathe.

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:18.920
What happened?

01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:23.341
I saw it.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.759
What? What did you see?

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.386
The Demogorgon.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:31.682
It's coming. It's coming for them.

01:03:32.266 --> 01:03:34.602
For who? Who's them?

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:44.444
Robin, stay here.

01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:47.197
Contact Hopper, the boys.
Tell everyone what's going on.

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:48.240
Right. Right.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.534
- Think you can get the power back on?
- I can try.

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:53.870
You do, you call my house
and tell everyone to get the hell out.

01:03:53.871 --> 01:03:54.789
Okay.

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:23.085
Mom!

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:26.464
Mom!

01:05:50.154 --> 01:05:52.322
I said upside down, you're turning me

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:54.783
You're giving love instinctively

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:57.036
'Round and 'round, you're turning me

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:01.123
Upside down

01:06:02.124 --> 01:06:05.627
Boy, you turn me inside out

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:08.129
And 'round and 'round

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:10.049

01:06:14.595 --> 01:06:16.722
And 'round and 'round

01:06:18.015 --> 01:06:22.352
Instinctively, you give to me
The love that I need

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:25.773
I cherish the moments with you

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.650
Respectfully, I say to thee

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:31.152
I'm aware that you're cheating

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:34.240
When no one makes me feel like you do

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.492
Upside down

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:41.037
Boy, you turn me inside out

01:06:41.038 --> 01:06:43.456

And 'round and 'round

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.385
I know you got charm and appeal

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:57.679
You always play the field

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.850
I'm crazy to think you're all mine

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:06.187
As long as the sun continues to shine

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:09.941
There's a place in my heart for you
That's the bottom line

01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:12.028
Upside down

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:16.197

I'm aware that you're cheating

01:07:41.682 --> 01:07:44.518
But no one makes me feel like you do

01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:47.271
Upside down
