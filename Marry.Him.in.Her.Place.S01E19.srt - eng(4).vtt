Lin Yun.

00:01:46.792 --> 00:01:47.912
Lin Yun.

00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:49.712
Lin Yun.

00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:02.592
Lin Yun.

00:02:03.712 --> 00:02:05.232
Lin Yun, wake up.

00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:07.672
Lin Yun, wake up! Lin Yun!

00:02:08.992 --> 00:02:11.592
Lin Yun, wake up.

00:02:12.592 --> 00:02:14.770
Lin Yun.

00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:17.631
Lin Yun.

00:02:17.632 --> 00:02:20.672
Wake up, Lin Yun.

00:02:21.337 --> 00:02:22.497
Lin Yun.

00:02:57.472 --> 00:02:59.952
Brother, I toast to you.

00:03:04.887 --> 00:03:06.072
I'll remember

00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:08.432
this kindness.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.020
When I'm gone, I'll repay you.

00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:17.672
I fear that after I send
Liang Yi away tonight,

00:03:18.752 --> 00:03:20.432
you and I will meet again soon.

00:03:21.512 --> 00:03:24.512
That day, none of us made it out.

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:27.407
Plus this bullet wound of mine.

00:03:28.432 --> 00:03:29.432
But,

00:03:30.992 --> 00:03:32.311
even if it costs me my life,

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:34.472
I will get her out safely.

00:03:46.272 --> 00:03:48.832
The sunlight is really warm.

00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:14.411
You should wear more outside.

00:04:14.412 --> 00:04:16.011
Your injury hasn't healed yet.

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:18.212
I know my own body. It's fine.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.289
What porridge is this?

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.570
Longevity porridge.

00:04:39.525 --> 00:04:40.644
It's sweet.

00:04:40.645 --> 00:04:42.324
When I got sick as a child,

00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:44.484
my father always made
sweet porridge for me.

00:04:44.485 --> 00:04:47.391
Maybe eating something sweet
makes you feel better,

00:04:47.392 --> 00:04:50.032
so your body feels less uncomfortable.

00:04:50.612 --> 00:04:52.412
I see.

00:05:00.752 --> 00:05:01.872
It really does feel better.

00:05:19.192 --> 00:05:20.712
Don't worry.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.992
We will definitely escape.

00:05:23.512 --> 00:05:24.592
Trust me.

00:05:25.312 --> 00:05:26.512
Okay.

00:06:37.192 --> 00:06:38.591
Where did you go?

00:06:38.592 --> 00:06:40.111
We should get moving.

00:06:40.112 --> 00:06:41.672
Hurry and change your clothes.

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:48.592
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

00:06:55.872 --> 00:06:57.672
Song Ming's men will arrive soon.

00:06:59.272 --> 00:07:00.392
We take the back door.

00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:06.711
What's wrong?

00:07:06.712 --> 00:07:08.592
I was the one who notified Song Ming.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:10.832
Why?

00:07:11.987 --> 00:07:13.786
Song Ming is hunting you,

00:07:13.787 --> 00:07:15.824
and he cut off all of
the Liang family's business.

00:07:15.825 --> 00:07:19.031
The Liang family's foundation
was built by my father's hard work.

00:07:19.032 --> 00:07:20.792
He's gone now.

00:07:21.762 --> 00:07:23.922
I can't let the Liang family collapse.

00:07:24.512 --> 00:07:26.271
I made a deal with Song Ming.

00:07:26.272 --> 00:07:28.071
As long as I hand you over,

00:07:28.072 --> 00:07:30.592
both the Liang family and I
will be safe.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.680
I don't believe you.

00:07:37.352 --> 00:07:39.271
I'm sorry, Lin Yun.

00:07:39.272 --> 00:07:40.832
I had no choice.

00:07:48.552 --> 00:07:51.151
Do you know what you're saying?

00:07:51.152 --> 00:07:52.391
Of course I do.

00:07:52.392 --> 00:07:54.671
During this time on the run,
I thought it through.

00:07:54.672 --> 00:07:56.872
I was born a wealthy daughter.

00:07:57.632 --> 00:07:59.431
I can't live your wandering life,

00:07:59.432 --> 00:08:01.312
a life of fighting and bloodshed.

00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:04.872
Nor do I want to be a fugitive.

00:08:05.792 --> 00:08:08.111
You protected me all along,

00:08:08.112 --> 00:08:09.832
and I couldn't help feeling guilty.

00:08:10.032 --> 00:08:11.511
But thinking carefully,

00:08:11.512 --> 00:08:13.791
from the start we agreed,
it was just cooperation.

00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:15.991
A mutually beneficial relationship.

00:08:15.992 --> 00:08:18.791
What you did wasn't just for me.

00:08:18.792 --> 00:08:20.392
So why should I feel guilty?

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.231
Some things,

00:08:24.232 --> 00:08:25.911
whoever takes them seriously

00:08:25.912 --> 00:08:26.751
loses.

00:08:26.752 --> 00:08:28.112
Enough.

00:08:28.392 --> 00:08:29.712
Stop talking!

00:08:31.462 --> 00:08:33.382
Did you ever

00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:37.575
even a little, truly care about me?

00:08:38.632 --> 00:08:40.112
I told you,

00:08:40.992 --> 00:08:42.591
it was sympathy,

00:08:42.592 --> 00:08:44.032
it was being moved,

00:08:46.552 --> 00:08:47.832
it was impulse.

00:08:48.712 --> 00:08:50.352
But now I'm calm.

00:08:51.272 --> 00:08:52.912
And my choice is

00:09:01.272 --> 00:09:02.552
to give you up.

00:09:36.592 --> 00:09:40.192
Liang Yi, you really kept your word.

00:09:52.312 --> 00:09:55.832
I hope you will keep your promise,
Mayor Song.

00:10:03.587 --> 00:10:05.147
Take him away.

00:10:12.152 --> 00:10:13.951
(Liang Yi.)

00:10:13.952 --> 00:10:16.152

Mayor Song, you and your son
truly share the same cruel methods.

Exactly alike.

00:11:04.472 --> 00:11:05.911
Lin Yun.

00:11:05.912 --> 00:11:08.551
I always thought you were a smart man.

00:11:08.552 --> 00:11:09.311
Didn't expect

00:11:09.312 --> 00:11:12.631
you'd be fooled completely by a woman.

00:11:12.632 --> 00:11:15.991
If you ask me,
you're worse off than Liang Yi.

00:11:15.992 --> 00:11:18.631
At least she knows what she's doing.

00:11:18.632 --> 00:11:21.151
You'd never imagine

00:11:21.152 --> 00:11:23.512
the one who sold you out
was Liang Yi, right?

00:11:30.472 --> 00:11:31.592
Come in.

00:11:37.952 --> 00:11:40.071
Finally, you're here.

00:11:40.072 --> 00:11:41.349
Where's Lin Yun?

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.791
We didn't capture her.

00:11:42.792 --> 00:11:44.392
She came to us herself.

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:47.631
Mayor Song.

00:11:47.632 --> 00:11:49.552
I'm here to negotiate a deal with you.

00:11:50.792 --> 00:11:52.871
You killed Zhichu.

00:11:52.872 --> 00:11:55.911
I only wanted you to be buried
with my son.

00:11:55.912 --> 00:11:58.151
But why not listen to my proposal first?

00:11:58.152 --> 00:11:59.711
If you're not interested,

00:11:59.712 --> 00:12:01.552
you can kill me afterward.

00:12:12.512 --> 00:12:13.431
Leave us.

00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:14.352
Yes.

00:12:19.032 --> 00:12:20.872
I can tell you where Lin Yun is.

00:12:22.432 --> 00:12:23.151
I warn you,

00:12:23.152 --> 00:12:24.871
don't play tricks.

00:12:24.872 --> 00:12:27.272
I've heard about you
and Lin Yun long ago.

00:12:27.832 --> 00:12:29.151
I'm serious.

00:12:29.152 --> 00:12:31.071
Song Zhichu was killed by Lin Yun.

00:12:31.072 --> 00:12:32.871
I don't want to die with him.

00:12:32.872 --> 00:12:34.632
Why should I believe you?

00:12:35.272 --> 00:12:38.192
Because my life is in your hands now.

00:12:49.752 --> 00:12:51.471
I suppose, Mayor Song,

00:12:51.472 --> 00:12:53.592
you already know who I am.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.960
Liang Yi.

00:12:55.832 --> 00:12:59.551
Since that's clear, I'll speak plainly.

00:12:59.552 --> 00:13:01.351
Song Zhichu colluded
with my second uncle,

00:13:01.352 --> 00:13:02.751
secretly selling opium.

00:13:02.752 --> 00:13:04.951
He tricked me step by step
into marriage.

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:07.071
On our wedding day, he killed my father.

00:13:07.072 --> 00:13:08.911
He disfigured me and dumped my body.

00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:11.911
Have you ever looked into these things,
Mayor Song?

00:13:11.912 --> 00:13:13.151
You're framing him.

00:13:13.152 --> 00:13:14.911
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:13:14.912 --> 00:13:16.672
I lived through it.

00:13:18.352 --> 00:13:21.672
Seems like you don't know
your own son very well.

00:13:22.375 --> 00:13:23.751
This is why

00:13:23.752 --> 00:13:26.871
I was desperately seeking revenge
on Song Zhichu before.

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.751
Even if all of this is true,

00:13:29.752 --> 00:13:31.631
what good does telling me do?

00:13:31.632 --> 00:13:33.391
Zhichu is already dead.

00:13:33.392 --> 00:13:35.991
But if I expose all of this publicly,

00:13:35.992 --> 00:13:40.072
your incoming position
as provincial chairman might not last.

00:13:40.212 --> 00:13:42.111
If I kill you right now,

00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:43.912
no one will ever know.

00:13:46.432 --> 00:13:49.671
Did you think I'd come
to negotiate with you

00:13:49.672 --> 00:13:52.071
without preparing a backup plan?

00:13:52.072 --> 00:13:54.336
If anything happens to me
in the Song Residence today,

00:13:54.337 --> 00:13:56.951
I guarantee every newspaper
in Rong City tomorrow

00:13:56.952 --> 00:13:59.732
will publish Zhichu's crimes.

00:14:00.112 --> 00:14:01.872
Do you dare to gamble?

00:14:08.192 --> 00:14:09.912
As long as you agree to spare me,

00:14:10.592 --> 00:14:12.231
I guarantee

00:14:12.232 --> 00:14:14.551
I'll never mention the past again.

00:14:14.552 --> 00:14:17.191
All evidence will be destroyed.

00:14:17.192 --> 00:14:19.111
From now on, every year,

00:14:19.112 --> 00:14:21.232
30% of Liang family profits go to you.

00:14:21.752 --> 00:14:25.551
You're really willing
to hand over Lin Yun?

00:14:25.552 --> 00:14:27.632
Absolutely.

00:14:30.072 --> 00:14:34.674
(Using my life in exchange
for you and the Liang family,)

00:14:34.675 --> 00:14:37.515
(what a profitable deal indeed.)

00:14:40.592 --> 00:14:42.432
That's the end of the story.

00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:44.992
Time to send you on your way.

00:14:49.112 --> 00:14:50.752
Master Song.

00:14:51.872 --> 00:14:54.152
Do you still remember Lin Siniang?

00:15:07.662 --> 00:15:09.720
Boss, there's actually another way.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.751
Why don't you just acknowledge
Song Ming as your father for now? Maybe...

00:15:11.752 --> 00:15:12.792
Shut up!

00:15:13.307 --> 00:15:14.986
Never bring this up again.

00:15:14.987 --> 00:15:16.924
Especially not in front of Liang Yi.

00:15:16.925 --> 00:15:19.086
I will never acknowledge him
as my father.
