00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:12.197
God damn it!

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:15.158
I closed the gate.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.077
I can break through.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.037
What are you doing?

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:21.538
I need food for my battery.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.708
You had a fully charged battery.
You didn't make a dent.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.212
No. We're not getting through that thing,
whatever it is, not this way at least.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.129
We have to.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.882
We don't even know
if Holly's on the other side.

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:35.303
The trail could've gone cold
for a million reasons.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:38.765
Battery.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:50.776
Anything else?

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.112
Hey! I... No, I don't have anything else.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:57.033
I was packing for a party of one,
a party of me.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:01.746
{\an8}You're lucky I'm sharing with you.

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:07.252
Try it.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.921
You might like it.

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:15.343
Hmm?

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.022
We gotta go.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.326
El?

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:41.702
You okay?

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.454
What's wrong? You all right?

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.341
Will, Robin, I need you to answer me.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.970
I'm not mad.
I just need to know you're safe.

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:05.518
Shit.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:07.311
- Is that, uh...
- Yeah.

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.772
You think she saw us?

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.108
Yeah.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:21.868
Get in.

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:27.206
I told you, I explicitly told you,

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:30.209
I didn't want him going anywhere
that's not safe.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.087
And not only did you take him,
you cut off all communication.

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:37.466
Yes, I mean, in retrospect,
that was a bit inconsiderate.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:38.592
Inconsiderate?

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.177
We really should've left a note.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:42.596
Is this funny to you?

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:44.014
Oh. Sorry. It must be my tone.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.099
My mother says
I sound perpetually insincere.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.145
Okay, this is my son's life
you're playing with.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:51.563
My son.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:55.442
So next time I say
I do not want him leaving my side,

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:59.071
that means I don't want him
leaving my goddamn side.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.448
I'm right here, Mom.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.367
You know, you can talk to me, right?

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:04.993
And I'm not a kid anymore.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:07.120
Will, I am still your mother.

00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:09.331
- Doesn't mean you know what you're doing.
- What?

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.458
Your plan? It... It sucked.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.709
I'm sorry, but it did.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.628
You only liked it because it was safe,

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.797
but we don't have time for safe,
not anymore.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.883
We have to act, and we have to take risks,
and thank God we did.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.135
Because my plan, it... it actually worked.

00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:24.721
I spied on Vecna
and tapped back into the hive mind,

00:04:24.722 --> 00:04:27.140
and we found out
that Holly was just the beginning.

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:28.767
Vecna is gonna take more kids.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.811
I don't know why
or what he wants to do with them,

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:34.274
but now we know something
we can use against him, his next target.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:38.194
So next time you order me to stay
by your side, I wouldn't count on it.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:43.992
But, as I said, in the future,
we will try to leave a note.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:49.205
We should go. We have to stop Vecna.
We don't have much time.

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.935
- Ready for the biosphere?
- Yes, I am.

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:15.647
Okay. Think about the difference
between land and water.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.442
Okay, got it. Thank you!

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:19.694
Hey!

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.297
You still thinking about your parents?

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:05.716
Yeah.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.470
They are in the very best possible hands,
Holly, I assure you.

00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:13.181
And I'm told that they are improving
with each hour that passes.

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:15.101
As soon as they're healed,
they'll join us here.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:16.811
I... I know.

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:19.564
- It's just--
- You wish to be with them.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.524
I understand.

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:24.902
But you cannot offer them comfort
in Hawkins, Holly.

00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:28.156
The only comfort they have
is knowing you are here, safe.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.991
With me.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:31.909
Safe from the monsters.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.081
I thought blackberries
might cheer you up a little.

00:07:38.082 --> 00:07:40.293
They're your favorite, aren't they?

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.961
How did you know?

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.045
That they're my favorite?

00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:45.672
Oh, it's, uh...

00:07:45.673 --> 00:07:46.716
It's just a hunch.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.634
I'm good with hunches.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.638
Perhaps tomorrow
I'll make chocolate chip pancakes.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.390
- He loves those.
- Who does?

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:56.850
Your classmate, Derek.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:58.685
Derek is coming here?

00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:01.647
You don't like Derek very much, do you?

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.569
Should I just let the monsters eat him?

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.574
No. No, you can't... you can't do that.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.076
Well, how about this?

00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:16.453
I will tell Derek

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:20.165
that if he misbehaves,
or if he hurts you in any way,

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:24.377
I will send him right back,
and he can face those monsters on his own.

00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:25.379
How does that sound?

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:34.638
I expect to be gone most of the day.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:37.807
While I'm out, you'll have
the whole house all to yourself.

00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:39.226
The whole house?

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.312
Everything which is mine is yours.

00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:44.982
But in return,
I need you to promise me one thing.

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:48.276
Something very important.
Do you think you can do that?

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:49.362
Yeah.

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:55.701
You must never, under any circumstance,
go out into the woods. Do you understand?

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.830
Is that where the monsters live?

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.917
But they won't find you.
That is, as long as you don't--

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.086
Don't try to find them.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.881
You know, I'm very glad I saved you first.

00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:11.884
You're the brightest of them all.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.807
Oh, and if you don't mind,
bring my mail in, won't you?

00:09:29.443 --> 00:09:30.444
How did you know?

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:32.154
A hunch.

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.459
Base, Alpha 1 checking in.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.045
We're arrived at checkpoint H,
H for Hercules.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:31.421
No sign of freak.

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:34.841
We'll recon this area,
then proceed to next checkpoint. Over.

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:38.386
Alpha 1, Base. Acknowledge
your location at Hercules. Over.

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:39.639
Alpha 1, out.

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:41.474
Recon?

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.851
Meaning, I take a leak,

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.062
and you guys take five.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.399
You heard the man.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.910
Some jackass messing with the wall,
Lieutenant?

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.037
Some jackass, yeah.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:48.374
But not one of ours.

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.210
Come on.

00:11:55.172 --> 00:11:56.507
Get on the hedgehog.

00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:58.592
Yes, sir.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.931
- Oh!
- Hey!

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.853
Come up! Come up!

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:54.899
Base, Alpha 1, we're taking enemy fire.
Need backup and air cover now.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.651
Move!

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.098
Okay.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.063
Who's there?

00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:13.162
It looks like
Robin sent up the Bat-Signal.

00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:31.472
Hey. I'm so sorry.

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:33.306
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:34.266
Here.

00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:37.852
Holy shit.

00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:38.978
Yep.

00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:41.857
Bike crash.
Flew headfirst into a light post.

00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:45.777
Look, I'm sorry about missing the crawl,
about everything.

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.987
It's not your fault.
Don't beat yourself up.

00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:49.781
Yeah, looks like he already did.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.240
- Is that broken?
- I dunno.

00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:52.659
- Let me...
- Don't touch it. Why--

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.702
- I wasn't.... I wanted to...
- You were going to.

00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:57.706
Hey, this isn't a social call, kiddos.
Let's go.

00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:04.253
Derek?

00:16:04.254 --> 00:16:05.380
Derek Turnbow?

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:09.050
As in the Turnbow family?
Like Turnbow Realty?

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:10.551
The one and only.

00:16:10.552 --> 00:16:12.553
Whole family's a menace.

00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:14.013
How can you be sure?

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:16.224
Sure that Derek's the next target?

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:18.394
Because I saw.

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:22.021
I've learned that
when I'm close enough to the hive mind,

00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:24.399
I can tap into it, into Vecna's mind.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.443
I can see who he's targeting.

00:16:27.194 --> 00:16:30.029
The first time it happened,
I saw through Holly's eyes

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.865
the same day she was taken.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.661
And this morning, it happened again.

00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:40.331
Only this time, I wasn't Holly.

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:42.000
- What the hell?
- I was someone else.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:44.336
- Watch where you're going, dipshit.
- Suck a fat one!

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.879
I was Derek Turnbow. I'm positive.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.006
Hold on. I'm a little lost.

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.215
Shocking.

00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:53.011
Were you seeing through the eyes
of... of Vecna or of Derek?

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.262
Both.

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:55.972
I... I was Vecna,

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:58.558
but inside Derek's mind.

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:00.935
Vecna's like a psychic serial killer.

00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:04.313
He stalks his victims,
but he does it by invading their minds.

00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:06.649
That's what he did with Chrissy and Max.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.361
Yeah, but the way
he's doing it this time is different.

00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:13.406
We did some digging at the hospital.
It turns out that before he took Holly,

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:14.574
Vecna stalked her.

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:18.454
But... he didn't appear as Vecna.
He appeared as Henry.

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.038
As a friend.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.123
We think he was trying to earn her trust.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:24.250
Now, why he went to all that trouble,
we don't know.

00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:26.878
But I highly doubt
his long-term goal is friendship.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.548
Whatever it is, whatever he's planning,

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.467
we have to stop him.

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.719
And we have to save Derek.

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.095
The Turnbows live here.

00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:37.805
We wait in a van across the street.

00:17:37.806 --> 00:17:40.641
As soon as they're asleep,
we move in, we grab Derek,

00:17:40.642 --> 00:17:43.269
and we take him to here,

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.439
the McCorkle farm.
It's completely isolated. It's abandoned.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.360
The only thing is, we need to make sure
he doesn't see us or know where he is.

00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:52.737
So we'll need to blindfold him.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.489
Wait. Hold on. What?

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.948
So that Vecna can't find him.

00:17:55.949 --> 00:17:59.744
Yeah. What, and Mom,
you're okay with just kidnapping a child?

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:02.663
No, we're saving a child via kidnapping.

00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:04.248
And yeah, it's fine,

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:05.166
I think.

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:08.336
Yes. Now's not the time
to play it safe, Jonathan.

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:10.171
If I may,

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:13.549
though I'm not morally opposed
to any of this, there are a few holes.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.678
Yeah. Like what if Derek falls asleep
before the Demogorgon attacks him?

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:18.679
That's one.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.934
Or what if Derek wakes up
before we grab him, alerts his family?

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.019
- We'll go to jail.
- There's another.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.980
But the third and most gaping hole is

00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:30.651
even if by some miracle
this plan even works,

00:18:31.151 --> 00:18:32.277
Holly's still missing.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.946
Hop and El, still MIA.

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:37.198
This doesn't bring us any closer
to finding Vecna.

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:39.826
This plan just buys us
and Derek some time.

00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:40.785
That's it.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.328
Not necessarily.

00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:43.622
There might be a way.

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:47.668
A way to save Derek and find Holly.

00:18:51.713 --> 00:18:52.548
This is Derek.

00:18:54.007 --> 00:18:56.885
And this is the rest
of the Turnbow family.

00:18:58.053 --> 00:19:00.680
We're gonna need to recruit someone
that the family trusts,

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:02.558
someone that can gain access to the house.

00:19:04.017 --> 00:19:05.893
This person will knock the family out.

00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:07.520
Then we'll extract the family.

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:08.604
Knock them out?

00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:11.440
Well, safely.
With sleeping pills or something.

00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:13.442
I might know
where we could get some benzos.

00:19:13.443 --> 00:19:15.736
Those things could knock an elephant
on its ass.

00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:17.488
Perfect. That way if Vecna spies,

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.782
he'll just assume
Derek is fast asleep in bed.

00:19:19.783 --> 00:19:21.493
He'll send his Demos to grab him.

00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:24.997
Only he won't find Derek. He'll find us.

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:26.539
And we'll be ready.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.333
We'll get Murray to supply us
with the traps.

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:32.211
We'll burn the sucker.
Send him scampering home to its master,

00:19:32.212 --> 00:19:34.506
but not before we stick him
with one of these.

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.426
We'll track the Demo
across the Upside Down

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:40.845
in the Squawk van
just like we did with Hopper.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:44.307
And if we're lucky,
the Demo will lead us back to its lair,

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:45.392
to Vecna,

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.186
to Holly.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:49.605
Holes?

00:19:57.487 --> 00:20:00.073
Children behave

00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:04.244
That's what they say
When we're together

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:08.331
'Cause what would they say

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:10.250
If they ever knew and so we're

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:14.004
Running just as fast as we can

00:20:15.088 --> 00:20:17.925
Holdin' onto one another's hand

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:21.427
Tryin' to get away into the night

00:20:21.428 --> 00:20:23.721
And then you put your arms around me

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:26.682
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

00:20:26.683 --> 00:20:29.602
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:33.523
There doesn't seem to be anyone around

00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:36.817
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:40.988
The beating of our hearts
Is the only sound

00:20:40.989 --> 00:20:44.701
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:51.749
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.003
The beating of our hearts
Is the only sound

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.090
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:02.177
There doesn't seem to be anyone around

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:06.556
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:23.657
Henry?

00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:29.413
Derek, if this is you,
it's not funny, you barf bag!

00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:09.577
"I need your help."

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.330
"Meet me at the X."

00:22:12.247 --> 00:22:13.290
"Henry."

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:24.718
East.

00:22:44.237 --> 00:22:47.073
Move aside.
Coming through! Make way, please!

00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:49.201
You're gonna be okay, man.
Just hang in there.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.289
Sir!

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:56.375
Orders?

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:00.212
Find who did this.

00:23:01.171 --> 00:23:02.130
Bring them to me.

00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:05.466
And I will disembowel the son of a bitch!

00:23:05.467 --> 00:23:06.675
Sir!

00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:08.303
Let's go! Move out!

00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:20.231
Got that Humvee hid pretty good.

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:23.192
If they don't know it's missing yet,
they will soon.

00:23:23.193 --> 00:23:24.443
Got more birds.

00:23:24.444 --> 00:23:26.863
They all got those speakers,
whatever they are.

00:23:30.784 --> 00:23:32.577
I don't know how, but...

00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:36.415
seems like our military friends
found your kryptonite.

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:40.252
Hey.

00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:42.754
Any movement from our guest?

00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:47.884
Better not be brain-dead.

00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:54.808
He peed on it.

00:23:57.727 --> 00:23:58.603
What?

00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:01.565
That soldier.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:03.816
You said he peed on the big wall.

00:24:03.817 --> 00:24:05.484
Yeah, no, I heard what you said.

00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:07.737
I just don't know
why you're talking about it.

00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:10.115
Maybe he knows what it is...

00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:12.367
or how to get through it.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.703
That's highly doubtful.

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:16.830
What he will know, though,

00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:19.707
is the schedule
for the next supply convoy,

00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:22.419
which is our way out of this hellhole.

00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:25.338
What happens then?

00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:31.261
We go back,
we tell everybody what we saw, and we... we...

00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:33.346
make a new plan.

00:24:34.347 --> 00:24:38.143
The others? You think
they'll know how to get through the wall?

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:41.645
I don't know. Maybe, yeah.

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:42.814
They won't.

00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:44.940
We'll be back to the first square.

00:24:44.941 --> 00:24:46.817
- Square one.
- He peed on it.

00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:48.861
Even if he knows something,

00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:51.281
he's been trained to resist interrogation.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.158
The Russians took two weeks
trying to break me,

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:55.784
and they still couldn't.

00:24:55.785 --> 00:24:58.538
We don't have two weeks.
We don't have two hours.

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:02.083
Convoy information,
I might be able to get out of him.

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:05.378
Classified information?
That's not gonna happen.

00:25:06.087 --> 00:25:07.254
With my help, it will.

00:25:07.255 --> 00:25:08.339
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.467
I forgot about your extensive training
in interrogation tactics.

00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:12.843
My battery's charged.

00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:14.512
I don't see how that helps us.

00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:16.055
- I can break him.
- El...

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:17.182
Twenty minutes.

00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:20.267
You get to ask him about the convoy.

00:25:20.268 --> 00:25:21.853
You get what you want,

00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:23.772
then I get what I want.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.485
Compromise. "C-O-M-promise." Remember?

00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:30.736
Halfway happy.

00:25:30.737 --> 00:25:33.240
Hey, what is this?

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:36.617
Get me outta here!
Get me the hell outta here!

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:38.787
You're a stubborn punk-ass.
You know that, right?

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.791
{\an8}Einstein-Rosen bridges,

00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:46.168
{\an8}more commonly known as wormholes,

00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:48.963
are often depicted
in an hourglass-like shape,

00:25:48.964 --> 00:25:50.048
such as this.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.009
While the existence of wormholes
is entirely theoretical,

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.636
they have captured the fascination

00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:59.014
of scientists
and science fiction writers alike.

00:25:59.015 --> 00:26:00.976
Can anyone tell me why that is?

00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.772
Come on. This is easy. Just...

00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:08.692
What's neat about wormholes?

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.071
Okay. Erica.

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:14.738
Wormholes are neat

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:18.492
because they allow matter to travel
between galaxies or dimensions

00:26:18.493 --> 00:26:20.369
without crossing the space between.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.372
Yes. Exactly right.

00:26:22.872 --> 00:26:24.039
Again.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.877
And, uh, just think of all the places
mankind could go.

00:26:28.878 --> 00:26:30.629
Another galaxy.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.423
Another time, even.

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:34.675
So why aren't we doing it now?

00:26:34.676 --> 00:26:39.555
If wormholes did exist,
they would be extraordinarily unstable.

00:26:39.556 --> 00:26:43.267
Their enormous gravitational force
would rip them apart

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:46.313
at the very moment they formed. Now...

00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:55.404
You have 60 seconds to explain
why you interrupted my favorite class.

00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:57.906
Erica, this is really serious.

00:26:57.907 --> 00:26:59.992
57, 56...

00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:02.453
It's hard
to explain everything in 56 seconds.

00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:05.956
But basically, everything went bad
at the crawl last night.

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.499
Wouldn't know. I wasn't invited.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.461
That's why I'm ex--

00:27:10.253 --> 00:27:12.004
That's why I'm explaining.

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:15.132
Things went bad at the crawl,
and a lot of stuff happened,

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:17.718
and now we think
Tina's little brother's in trouble.

00:27:17.719 --> 00:27:19.428
That literally makes no sense.

00:27:19.429 --> 00:27:22.931
And even if it did, why would I care
that Dipshit Derek is in trouble?

00:27:22.932 --> 00:27:25.059
You're just gonna have to trust us, okay?

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.854
And to help Derek, we're gonna need you
to get us into the Turnbow house.

00:27:28.855 --> 00:27:30.105
- Tonight.
- Not possible.

00:27:30.106 --> 00:27:32.191
Of course it is.
Make plans to hang out with Tina.

00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:35.194
- Tina and I don't hang.
- You hang nonstop. She's your best friend.

00:27:35.195 --> 00:27:36.195
- Was.
- Was?

00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:37.529
- We are now enemies.
- Enemies?

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.822
- Arch.
- Since when?

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:40.616
Since PE class 12 days ago.

00:27:40.617 --> 00:27:43.035
Then apologize for what happened
in PE class 12 days ago.

00:27:43.036 --> 00:27:45.037
- No can do.
- Yes, can do.

00:27:45.038 --> 00:27:49.458
All you have to do is use your mouth
to form a word that rhymes with "starry."

00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:52.586
I'd rather learn about wormholes
than apologize to Tina

00:27:52.587 --> 00:27:55.005
and help you all save Dipshit Derek.

00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:57.050
Sorry.

00:27:58.301 --> 00:27:59.302
Time's up.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.890
This isn't about saving Derek.
It's about saving Holly.

00:28:05.308 --> 00:28:06.393
Vecna took her.

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:10.729
And yeah, now he's after Dipshit Derek.
But we have a plan.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.982
A plan to both save Dipshit Derek
and find Holly.

00:28:13.983 --> 00:28:15.693
But the plan is...

00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:17.277
It's a bit insane.

00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:18.571
But after it's over,

00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:21.950
I don't think
Tina's gonna wanna talk to you ever again.

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:25.245
Well, why the hell
didn't you just start with that?

00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:36.213
Hi, Doris.

00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:38.632
Oh! You here to see Mrs. Massey?

00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:41.885
- You are just psychic, I'm telling you.
- I am. Thank you, baby.

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:44.055
- Thank you.
- Y'all go on back there.

00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:46.890
Mm!

00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:48.100
Who's Mrs. Massey?

00:28:48.101 --> 00:28:50.310
My sweet granny
who fell down a flight of stairs

00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:52.521
and broke nearly every bone
in her frail old body.

00:28:52.522 --> 00:28:54.106
Oh God. I'm sorry.

00:28:54.107 --> 00:28:56.233
Don't be too sorry.
She's not my real granny.

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:58.026
I use her name so I can visit Vickie.

00:28:58.027 --> 00:29:00.654
I know it sounds unethical,
but I always bring her cookies,

00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:03.615
and I think Mrs. Massey loves me
more than her own family at this point.

00:29:03.616 --> 00:29:07.161
More importantly, she has got, like,
a mondo stash of benzos,

00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:09.872
and her nurse is a slacker
who never locks the medicine cabinet.

00:29:09.873 --> 00:29:11.206
...this story I heard.

00:29:11.207 --> 00:29:12.459
- Shit.
- Oh!

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:15.294
- What... What are we doing?
- Hiding.

00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:17.380
- Hiding? Right. Why?
- Down.

00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:24.887
Jesus, she talks so much.

00:29:24.888 --> 00:29:26.472
- I know. I'm a hypocrite.
- I...

00:29:26.473 --> 00:29:27.640
We have to go!

00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:36.148
I promised Vickie
that I would take her to Enzo's tonight,

00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:38.150
and now I can't, obviously,

00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:39.777
meaning I have to ditch her again

00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:42.738
for reasons
that she just can't understand.

00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:46.200
A massive fight will ensue, and we'll
never make it to my fake granny's room.

00:29:46.201 --> 00:29:48.285
I can't be the reason
Wheeler's plan fails.

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:50.538
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:29:53.374 --> 00:29:54.375
Shoot. Stay low.

00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:06.805
You know,
you could always just kiss her again.

00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:09.598
I knew that was your goddamn bowl cut.

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:13.311
Yeah, I mean,
they're not that popular anymore.

00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:16.438
Did I look like
I knew what I was doing at least?

00:30:16.439 --> 00:30:19.400
I mean, yeah. To me.

00:30:20.735 --> 00:30:22.152
I guess that's something.

00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:25.323
So, how did you know
that, with Vickie, right?

00:30:25.949 --> 00:30:27.908
How did you know that Vickie wanted to...

00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:29.159
- Make out?
- ...to date?

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.871
Oh. Well, we volunteered together.
You know, there were, like, signals.

00:30:32.872 --> 00:30:34.122
Signals?

00:30:34.123 --> 00:30:38.044
Yeah, you know, like a brush of the knee,
a bump of the elbow, a shared look.

00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:42.172
It all just kind of accrued,
like a snowball rolling down a hill,

00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:43.299
until it was obvious.

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:45.426
How obvious?

00:30:46.553 --> 00:30:50.473
Let's say the, uh, snowball
became an avalanche.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.734
Oh God, that looks awful.

00:31:02.735 --> 00:31:03.735
Sure does.

00:31:03.736 --> 00:31:06.364
And he's in the same wing
as my fake granny.

00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:08.867
- Meaning?
- Same slacker nurse.

00:31:11.494 --> 00:31:12.786
Jackpot.

00:31:12.787 --> 00:31:15.622
Jesus, we could knock out half of Hawkins
with this shit.

00:31:15.623 --> 00:31:17.876
- Okay, load me up.
- Okay.

00:31:27.176 --> 00:31:29.177
Okay, so, I couldn't get any ethanol,

00:31:29.178 --> 00:31:33.557
but I was able to scrounge up
a gallon of acetone.

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:34.474
Be very careful.

00:31:34.475 --> 00:31:38.021
You smoke a Virginia Slim too close
to this stuff, it'll catch fire, okay?

00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:41.481
Snare wire, various gauges.

00:31:41.482 --> 00:31:45.485
A creepy, child-sized CPR dummy.

00:31:45.486 --> 00:31:47.572
Its purpose a mystery to me.

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:52.577
Shotgun shells,
per our lovely lady's request.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:57.247
{\an8}Three 20-packs of water balloons.
Purpose also a mystery.

00:31:57.248 --> 00:32:00.459
{\an8}But I did take the liberty
of selecting the grenade style

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.087
{\an8}as it felt thematically appropriate.

00:32:03.963 --> 00:32:06.299
Do keep those far away from...

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.594
these 3,000 feet of barbed wire.

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.764
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:32:13.514 --> 00:32:16.517
Some sparkling new spark plugs
for Bilbo Baggins.

00:32:19.228 --> 00:32:20.520
Spark plugs, that's it?

00:32:20.521 --> 00:32:22.314
I'm also giving out free hugs.

00:32:22.315 --> 00:32:24.107
- You didn't get the turbocharger?
- No.

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:25.525
- The suspension kit?
- No.

00:32:25.526 --> 00:32:27.110
- The aerodynamic spoiler?
- No.

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:29.280
It wasn't a goddamn Christmas list,
Murray.

00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:31.573
That's exactly what it was.

00:32:31.574 --> 00:32:35.118
And the fact that Santa Murray scrounged
all this up in a single afternoon

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:39.081
and smuggled it into what is likely
the most heavily secured location

00:32:39.082 --> 00:32:42.250
outside of the White House,
Fort Knox, and Area 51

00:32:42.251 --> 00:32:44.461
is a goddamn Christmas miracle.

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.838
So, count your blessings,

00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:49.091
hang some mistletoe, pucker up,

00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:51.844
and kiss my jolly ass!

00:32:54.597 --> 00:32:56.599
Thank you for the spark plugs.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.528
- What are you doing?
- You gonna help or just stand there?

00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:11.905
I'd rather not herniate a disc
over a lost cause.

00:33:11.906 --> 00:33:13.824
Yeah, that's the attitude.

00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:16.326
This van once stalled out
chugging up Pickett Road

00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:18.120
like it was
the Little Engine That Couldn't.

00:33:18.121 --> 00:33:21.707
It's not fast enough to keep up
with a Demo without serious modifications.

00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:24.252
What the hell do you think I'm doing?
Modifying.

00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:27.255
A lighter van is a faster van.

00:33:27.755 --> 00:33:30.716
If we're just tracking,
we don't need half of the crap in here.

00:33:30.717 --> 00:33:33.468
Speaking of, can you go
empty the window washer fluid?

00:33:33.469 --> 00:33:36.430
The window washer fluid.
That'll do it. Good job, Steven.

00:33:36.431 --> 00:33:38.640
We should go back
to the agreement from yesterday.

00:33:38.641 --> 00:33:41.227
- What agreement?
- The no-talking agreement.

00:33:50.486 --> 00:33:52.488
Oh yeah

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:56.116
What are you doing?
Henderson, I'm using that.

00:33:56.117 --> 00:33:57.951
Hey. You little shit!

00:33:57.952 --> 00:33:59.703
I said I'm using that, man.

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:01.788
What are you-- Yo, hey!

00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:04.332
Get off the Beamer, man. Get off!

00:34:04.333 --> 00:34:06.168
You were right. For once.

00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:08.628
We don't need half the crap in there
for our mission.

00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:12.674
In fact, the only thing
we really need is a telemetry tracker,

00:34:12.675 --> 00:34:15.385
which I can affix to any vehicle.

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:16.345
Henderson...

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:17.972
Don't you touch her.

00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:19.723
Henderson!

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.559
Henderson, I'm dead serious.

00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:24.936
- No talking.
- Wait, wait, wait!

00:34:24.937 --> 00:34:26.521
Hey, hey! What are you...

00:34:26.522 --> 00:34:28.399
No! What the...

00:34:31.694 --> 00:34:33.445
- Okay, transmitter?
- Yeah.

00:34:33.446 --> 00:34:35.948
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Children. Children.

00:34:36.824 --> 00:34:39.451
- What are we doing?
- What does it look like?

00:34:39.452 --> 00:34:45.624
Well, it looks like you're loading
my telemetry tracker into a shotgun shell

00:34:45.625 --> 00:34:47.584
in what I presume are the hopes

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:50.504
of firing it
into an interdimensional being.

00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:52.589
You told me that these transmitters

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:56.176
were designed specifically
to withstand harsh conditions.

00:34:56.177 --> 00:35:00.680
Blasting it out of a shotgun
into some beast isn't a harsh condition.

00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:01.640
It's deadly.

00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:05.352
If the heat from the exploding gunpowder
doesn't destroy the transmitter,

00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:07.062
the force from the recoil will.

00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:09.648
And is that a fact

00:35:09.649 --> 00:35:11.609
or... a theory?

00:35:14.362 --> 00:35:15.278
A theory.

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:16.948
Oh. Okay.

00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:19.784
Let's test it then.

00:35:22.745 --> 00:35:24.246
What's her deal today, huh?

00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:25.580
Her deal?

00:35:25.581 --> 00:35:26.666
Yeah.

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:30.961
Her sister is missing.
Her parents almost died.

00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:34.005
- Sure, sure. But what about, you know?
- No, I don't.

00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:35.590
Coltrane, Love Supreme.

00:35:35.591 --> 00:35:37.676
- Did you give it a whirl?
- Yeah.

00:35:37.677 --> 00:35:39.636
- And?
- It was very nice.

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:41.763
- And?
- What? Thank you?

00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:43.975
Christ, man!
You haven't done it yet, have you?

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:47.477
I thought you were desperate,
that things were stagnating,

00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:49.354
that your mating competition
was making moves.

00:35:49.355 --> 00:35:50.438
- Whoa!
- Hey!

00:35:50.439 --> 00:35:54.025
Whatever you two are conspiring about
back there, please do it later.

00:35:54.026 --> 00:35:55.652
Our apologies, milady.

00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:57.655
And hurry up. We don't have all day.

00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:00.949
Why the delay?

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:02.075
Have you forgotten the fact

00:36:02.076 --> 00:36:04.995
that her sister is missing
and her parents are in the hospital?

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:07.038
Could one ask for better conditions?

00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:10.542
The death of a loved one
is the painful but necessary reminder

00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:13.378
that life is delicate, precious,

00:36:13.379 --> 00:36:16.131
that one must not take those around us
for granted,

00:36:16.132 --> 00:36:17.924
that one must strengthen bonds.

00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:19.092
I mean, hell, man,

00:36:19.093 --> 00:36:22.762
the two of you were brought together
by shared trauma in the first place.

00:36:22.763 --> 00:36:25.056
This is the stuff of fate, of destiny.

00:36:25.057 --> 00:36:27.267
So, if not for your sake, then for mine.

00:36:27.268 --> 00:36:29.978
Grow some balls
and get it over with already.

00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:32.772
Hey! If you don't shut up
right now, Santa,

00:36:32.773 --> 00:36:36.444
I swear to God I will shoot this tracker
into your potato sacks.

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:38.863
I'm a good enough shot to hit any mark,

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:40.655
no matter how small.

00:36:40.656 --> 00:36:41.865
Jesus.

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:43.367
Now set up my target.

00:36:43.993 --> 00:36:44.994
Okay.

00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:57.965
Quite large, actually.

00:36:58.549 --> 00:37:01.052
My... potato sacks.

00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:05.765
Hmm.

00:37:14.982 --> 00:37:17.944
Well, would you look at that, Santa?
Another miracle.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.113
At the very least,

00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:23.282
couldn't hurt her mood.

00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:46.973
Hey!

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.641
How's the head?

00:37:49.308 --> 00:37:51.060
You'll get nothing out of me.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.853
So if you're gonna kill me, get to it.

00:37:53.854 --> 00:37:55.231
It's tempting.

00:37:56.148 --> 00:37:57.149
But no.

00:37:58.192 --> 00:38:00.403
Just need a little information, okay?

00:38:02.822 --> 00:38:05.157
I need to know about that fleshy wall.

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:09.161
Don't know a thing about it.
I'm just a grunt.

00:38:09.745 --> 00:38:11.580
A grunt?

00:38:12.164 --> 00:38:13.291
Is that funny to you?

00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:16.167
Let me get this straight.
You're telling me you just,

00:38:16.168 --> 00:38:19.921
like all the other boots on the ground,
came to Hawkins to direct traffic

00:38:19.922 --> 00:38:21.589
and save kitty cats out of trees.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:24.635
- You're just a red, white, and blue grunt.
- That's what I said.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.263
I used to be a grunt.

00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:30.558
So I know the difference.

00:38:33.227 --> 00:38:34.645
You're something else.

00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:37.773
Some kind of special forces puke.

00:38:38.774 --> 00:38:41.484
I used to have to put up
with guys like you in Nam.

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:44.154
Guys who cut the ears off enemy corpses,

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:45.906
make a necklace out of them.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.200
Pretty sick, you ask me.

00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:53.080
Grunt, my ass.
You're one of Sullivan's attack dogs.

00:38:54.123 --> 00:38:56.207
You're the psychos
he lets slip off the leash

00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:58.877
when he wants to,
I don't know, go into the desert

00:38:58.878 --> 00:39:03.340
and massacre a group of unarmed scientists
all in the pursuit of one little girl.

00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:04.675
Little... Little girl?

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:06.510
She's a freak!

00:39:07.219 --> 00:39:10.138
She took down a helicopter
just by looking at it.

00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:11.556
I had friends in that Huey, man.

00:39:11.557 --> 00:39:14.059
Oh my God! My heart is breaking for you.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.644
You, whoever you are,
you just took out more of my guys,

00:39:16.645 --> 00:39:18.104
so go to hell.

00:39:18.105 --> 00:39:20.190
I'm already there. Look around you.

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:22.776
I gotta tell you something
about this old ex-grunt.

00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:26.030
Those guys I killed,
I'd kill them a hundred times over.

00:39:26.822 --> 00:39:29.074
I'd kill a thousand guys like you

00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:30.910
to protect the one person that I love.

00:39:35.247 --> 00:39:36.207
All right.

00:39:37.249 --> 00:39:39.460
So you don't know about the wall, huh?

00:39:40.252 --> 00:39:41.504
Who does?

00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:43.381
Dr. Kay?

00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:47.051
- Who?
- Kay.

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:49.553
The one
that even Sullivan takes orders from.

00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:52.723
- Don't know who you're talking about.
- Really?

00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:54.849
Then why'd you tell us her name?

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:55.892
What?

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:59.521
Her name. You told us her name.

00:39:59.522 --> 00:40:00.523
Us?

00:40:01.023 --> 00:40:03.525
That little girl you're looking for?

00:40:03.526 --> 00:40:07.070
She's rooting around
in that tiny brain of yours as we speak.

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:09.239
She can see everything.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.784
Everything you've ever thought,
everything you've ever seen.

00:40:12.785 --> 00:40:14.744
So you might as well start talking.

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:17.455
'Cause if you don't give me answers,
she'll find them.

00:40:17.456 --> 00:40:19.667
So why don't we save some time?

00:40:20.376 --> 00:40:22.127
Where do I find Dr. Kay?

00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:24.838
I... I don't know where she is.

00:40:24.839 --> 00:40:27.298
You can lie to me all you want.
You can't lie to her.

00:40:27.299 --> 00:40:29.593
- I'm not lying to you.
- Yes, you are.

00:40:30.177 --> 00:40:33.931
You know this Dr. Kay. Where is Dr. Kay?

00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:36.183
I don't know--

00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:45.443
Is it really necessary to take
these lashings from Kay in person?

00:40:47.027 --> 00:40:48.821
Just shut up and drive, Akers.

00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:02.168
There's a base in the Upside Down.

00:41:02.751 --> 00:41:04.044
Gable Ridge Road.

00:41:04.545 --> 00:41:08.715
- Gable Ridge Road Base.
- What the hell is she doing to me?

00:41:08.716 --> 00:41:11.759
I don't exactly know how it works,
but I know it's probably not a good idea

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.970
to have her rooting around there
for too long.

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:16.639
What was this meeting about
with you and the good doctor?

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.936
The freak. She wants the freak.
That's her mission. That's all I know.

00:41:22.104 --> 00:41:24.732
You have one more month,
Lieutenant Colonel.

00:41:25.357 --> 00:41:28.235
Then I find someone else
to lead this operation.

00:41:30.529 --> 00:41:31.738
Thank you, ma'am.

00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:33.115
Akers, let's go.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.519
There's a door at the end.

00:42:02.394 --> 00:42:04.396
Big, metal,

00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:06.397
like a vault.

00:42:06.398 --> 00:42:11.277
There's a door, a big door, secure door,
down a corridor, down a hallway.

00:42:11.278 --> 00:42:12.987
- What's behind that door?
- I don't know.

00:42:12.988 --> 00:42:14.864
What's behind that door?

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:17.743
I told you I don't know. God!

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:26.085
There's something back there.
He doesn't want me to see.

00:42:27.461 --> 00:42:30.380
- My head! My head!
- Hey, I can make it stop.

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.674
What's behind the door?

00:42:32.675 --> 00:42:35.511
Secret shit. I don't know.
Just get the freak out, man.

00:42:40.182 --> 00:42:42.559
I can make it stop,
but you gotta tell me the truth.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.726
What's behind that door?

00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:45.478
Does it have something to do
with the wall?

00:42:45.479 --> 00:42:46.854
I told you I don't know.

00:42:46.855 --> 00:42:49.233
Come on! What's behind the door?!

00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:04.622
I swear to God, I don't know!

00:43:04.623 --> 00:43:07.334
Just get her out of my head!
Get her out of my head!

00:43:12.047 --> 00:43:13.132
Hey, hey, hey!

00:43:18.304 --> 00:43:19.138
Hey!

00:43:24.226 --> 00:43:26.103
Hey! Hey!

00:43:27.146 --> 00:43:29.647
What the hell was that? What happened?

00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:32.442
El, are you all right? El?

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:33.443
Kryptonite.

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:34.694
What?

00:43:34.695 --> 00:43:37.865
I heard it behind the door,
louder than before.

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:40.117
The doctor's keeping someone there,

00:43:40.743 --> 00:43:42.453
someone powerful like me.

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:44.955
It has to be.

00:43:45.539 --> 00:43:46.790
It has to be what?

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:48.876
The military,

00:43:49.877 --> 00:43:50.961
they have him.

00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:54.423
They have Vecna.

00:43:57.092 --> 00:44:01.972
It doesn't make sense. Henry said never
to go into the woods. Never, ever.

00:44:04.725 --> 00:44:06.685
Why am I talking to you anyways?

00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:10.856
You're a pop star.
What do you know about monsters?

00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:31.835
What would you do?

00:45:08.956 --> 00:45:10.124
Stupid.

00:45:40.654 --> 00:45:42.780
It smells like ass in here, dipshit.

00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:45.074
Probably from all my farts.

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.617
Disgusting.

00:45:46.618 --> 00:45:48.119
Mom wants you down for dinner.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.372
Mom can suck a fat one.

00:45:55.127 --> 00:45:56.295
Hey!

00:45:58.046 --> 00:46:00.090
Tina! Give it back, Tina!

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:02.885
Tina!

00:46:05.637 --> 00:46:07.598
Ah, ah, ah. Enough.

00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:12.436
How many times must I repeat myself?
This home is not a playground.

00:46:14.021 --> 00:46:18.816
Derek, wash up.
Tina, get the door, and be polite.

00:46:18.817 --> 00:46:20.443
Unless it's a Mormon.

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:21.695
Or a Democrat.

00:46:22.654 --> 00:46:25.783
Listen, I know
you probably hate me right now,

00:46:26.492 --> 00:46:29.369
but I thought
you might want your favorite pie.

00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:33.206
And also, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

00:46:33.207 --> 00:46:36.835
I'm so sorry, Tina.

00:46:44.927 --> 00:46:45.928
She's in.

00:46:46.762 --> 00:46:47.679
She's in.

00:46:48.847 --> 00:46:49.680
Hey. What...

00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:51.809
Sinclair, come in. Do you copy?

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:55.436
Yep, this is Sinclair. Copy. Go ahead.

00:46:55.437 --> 00:46:59.065
Sinclair, I'm confused. I thought
your sister said that Tina was mean.

00:46:59.066 --> 00:47:01.734
Oh, no, no.
She's not mean. She's a villain.

00:47:01.735 --> 00:47:03.945
Kill the puppies
for a fur coat kind of villain.

00:47:03.946 --> 00:47:05.197
Trust me.

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:08.115
How long before the drugs kick in?

00:47:08.116 --> 00:47:10.827
- Depends how much pie they eat.
- And how fast they eat it.

00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:14.288
- What they had for lunch.
- Caffeine intake, alcohol intake.

00:47:14.289 --> 00:47:15.540
It's a lot of variables.

00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:17.376
Yeah, what could go wrong, right?

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.170
Aside from everything.

00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:26.634
Aw, you know,
I'm so happy you girls made up.

00:47:26.635 --> 00:47:28.678
We've missed you, Erica. Haven't we, dear?

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:31.347
- We missed this pie, that's for sure.
- Hmm.

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:34.016
Now, Erica,
you've done something different this time.

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:35.101
Sorry?

00:47:35.102 --> 00:47:38.980
Your pie. It's got
a little... something extra tonight.

00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:40.731
A little hint of...

00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:41.649
Nutmeg.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.651
Nutmeg! Of course.

00:47:43.652 --> 00:47:47.196
Brilliant. Brilliant. Brill... Brilliant.

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:49.699
Tina, aren't you gonna try some?

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:53.995
Oh, I wish. Looks super good.
Just gotta watch those calories, you know.

00:47:53.996 --> 00:47:55.746
Fatty McFatFat.

00:47:55.747 --> 00:47:57.874
Derek, remember what we talked about.

00:47:57.875 --> 00:48:01.168
If you don't have something nice to say,
don't say it at all.

00:48:01.169 --> 00:48:04.839
This is how
you alienate your spears, Derek.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.090
My spears?

00:48:06.091 --> 00:48:10.428
Your spears. Sph... Spheres. Peers.

00:48:10.429 --> 00:48:12.680
Holy shit, Dad's wasted again.

00:48:12.681 --> 00:48:14.932
Derek. Please, language.

00:48:14.933 --> 00:48:19.020
{\an8}Well, I used a low-fat creamer,
so you can enjoy guilt-free.

00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:21.481
{\an8}Thanks, but I'm just not hungry.

00:48:22.065 --> 00:48:23.649
But I made it for you.

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:25.693
I said I'm not hungry.

00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:27.028
Just a bite or two.

00:48:27.029 --> 00:48:29.322
- Okay, why are you being so weird?
- What?

00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:31.616
Why do you care so much
if I eat your stupid pie?

00:48:31.617 --> 00:48:33.367
Because it's for you.

00:48:33.368 --> 00:48:35.661
Oh my God.
It's because you want me fat, isn't it?

00:48:35.662 --> 00:48:38.122
- Girls, please.
- Why would I want you fat?

00:48:38.123 --> 00:48:40.166
Because you're still jealous
of me and Josh,

00:48:40.167 --> 00:48:42.668
and you wanna sabotage our chances
of being together.

00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:45.212
I was never jealous of you and Josh.

00:48:45.213 --> 00:48:48.591
- Then how do you explain PE?
- It was an accident.

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:50.927
Ken, where are you going?

00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:52.345
I'm not feeling good.

00:48:52.346 --> 00:48:53.888
It wasn't an accident.

00:48:53.889 --> 00:48:56.682
It was dodgeball.
In dodgeball, you throw balls at people.

00:48:56.683 --> 00:49:00.311
Not that hard. You gave Joshy
a black eye. Now he won't even look at me.

00:49:00.312 --> 00:49:02.730
That's stupid. You didn't throw the ball.

00:49:02.731 --> 00:49:04.607
It doesn't matter. He associates us.

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:07.610
He associates us. And you humiliated him.

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:11.073
He humiliated himself
by crying like a goddamn pussy.

00:49:15.243 --> 00:49:16.119
Ken?

00:49:19.414 --> 00:49:20.499
Oh my God.

00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:23.126
Mommy!

00:49:25.253 --> 00:49:26.170
Mom.

00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:28.464
Erica, call 911! Erica!

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:29.633
Mom, wake up.

00:49:30.258 --> 00:49:31.092
Erica!

00:49:31.093 --> 00:49:33.719
Mommy, wake up. Daddy.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.972
Erica, I told you to call 911.

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:40.310
And I told you to eat your damn pie.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.269
- This is gonna work.
- It better work.

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:30.897
It's not like we're conspicuous
or anything.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.237
Hey. Talk to me, guys.
How's it looking out there?

00:52:38.238 --> 00:52:39.280
It's boring.

00:52:39.281 --> 00:52:41.407
How are the Turnbows holding up?

00:52:41.408 --> 00:52:45.911
They're still in their "food comas,"
but I swear to God, this Demo better show.

00:52:45.912 --> 00:52:47.955
If we took out an entire family
for nothing,

00:52:47.956 --> 00:52:50.584
my conscience will never recover.

00:52:59.384 --> 00:53:00.594
I thought you quit.

00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:02.345
Quit what?

00:53:03.722 --> 00:53:04.806
Pretty smooth.

00:53:05.307 --> 00:53:06.349
Thanks.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.225
Where's your coat?

00:53:08.226 --> 00:53:09.602
It's in the barn.

00:53:09.603 --> 00:53:12.772
Well, you should get it
if you're gonna be out here.

00:53:14.399 --> 00:53:15.400
Mom,

00:53:16.151 --> 00:53:17.234
about this morning...

00:53:17.235 --> 00:53:18.652
Will, it's fine.

00:53:18.653 --> 00:53:20.321
No, no, it's not.

00:53:20.322 --> 00:53:24.992
I shouldn't have talked to you that way,
and I was a jerk, and I'm sorry.

00:53:24.993 --> 00:53:27.162
Honey, I'm sorry too.

00:53:28.288 --> 00:53:29.789
I know I can be...

00:53:30.624 --> 00:53:32.292
I can be a lot.

00:53:33.335 --> 00:53:34.753
That's not true.

00:53:35.587 --> 00:53:38.924
It's just,
when I couldn't find you this morning...

00:53:39.674 --> 00:53:40.508
I don't know.

00:53:42.677 --> 00:53:45.847
I think about that night all the time.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.224
The night it came for you,

00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:50.309
the night all this started.

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:53.063
I wasn't even home.

00:53:53.772 --> 00:53:55.189
My shift ran late.

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:57.233
When I finally do get home, what do I do?

00:53:57.234 --> 00:54:04.157
I smoke cigarettes, drink cheap wine,
and watch Cheers reruns until I pass out.

00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:08.953
I didn't know you were missing
for eight hours.

00:54:08.954 --> 00:54:12.706
Mom, what happened to me,
it's not your fault.

00:54:12.707 --> 00:54:14.626
Eight hours.

00:54:16.836 --> 00:54:20.131
What kind of mother
doesn't check on their 11-year-old boy?

00:54:23.051 --> 00:54:24.510
That is ridiculous!

00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:27.097
The jury's still out on your new friend.

00:54:28.306 --> 00:54:30.934
She certainly is interesting.

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:35.939
But one thing I know for sure,

00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:38.024
she's not your mom.

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:41.318
She hasn't seen what I've seen,

00:54:41.319 --> 00:54:43.612
and I am not gonna look away.

00:54:43.613 --> 00:54:48.742
Not again.
Not until this is over, and you're safe.

00:54:48.743 --> 00:54:54.708
You don't have to look away, Mom.
I... I just... I need you to trust me.

00:54:55.417 --> 00:54:57.543
I do trust you, Will.

00:54:57.544 --> 00:55:01.047
But, you know, trust is a two-way street.

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:07.595
Even though my plan last night
kind of sucked...

00:55:08.263 --> 00:55:10.390
- Kind of?
- Hey!

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.685
Let's get your coat on.

00:55:14.686 --> 00:55:17.564
It's a lot harder to save the world
if you have the sniffles.

00:55:21.026 --> 00:55:25.154
So, like, what kind of criminals
does your uncle defend exactly?

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:27.698
You know,
are they, like, white-collar criminals?

00:55:27.699 --> 00:55:30.492
Because that does seem like
a Harrington thing to do,

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:32.411
like, defend rich douchebags.

00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:33.495
And in this situation,

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:36.541
I think that the rich douchebags
would be coming for us.

00:55:39.919 --> 00:55:40.753
Steve?

00:55:40.754 --> 00:55:42.588
Steve? Are you there?

00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:44.340
Yeah, I hear you. Just stop talking.

00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:45.842
I think we've got company.

00:55:47.344 --> 00:55:50.554
Moving south down Arlington,
T-minus 30 seconds.

00:55:50.555 --> 00:55:52.890
South down Arlington, T-minus 30 seconds.

00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:54.558
Status check. Taggers?

00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:56.810
In position and set. Launcher?

00:55:56.811 --> 00:55:58.772
Set. Catcher?

00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:00.690
Set. Trackers?

00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:03.818
Set. Let's do this thing already.

00:56:18.291 --> 00:56:19.291
It's inside.

00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:20.501
Minimize chatter.

00:56:20.502 --> 00:56:22.545
It's inside. Keep your traps shut.

00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:26.401
Catch this!

00:58:01.269 --> 00:58:02.312
Get him!

00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:13.114
Now!

00:58:19.078 --> 00:58:20.079
Nancy!

00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:23.082
Nancy! Hurry! Come on!

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:29.297
Get him, Mike! Get him, Mike!
Mike, get him! Get him!

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:32.800
Ah!

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:37.638
It flipped! It flipped!

00:58:37.639 --> 00:58:41.683
Signal acquired. Headed our way.

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:42.852
How close?

00:58:44.062 --> 00:58:45.230
Dustin, how close?

00:58:46.773 --> 00:58:48.857
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:51.068
Shit.

00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:52.612
Jesus Christ!

00:58:53.404 --> 00:58:54.363
Where is it?

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:56.032
Hold your horses.

00:58:58.243 --> 00:59:00.370
Bearing northwest and fast.

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:03.580
- Oh, come on.
- Demo tagged and released.

00:59:03.581 --> 00:59:07.210
Trackers in pursuit.
Repeat, trackers in pursuit. Hit it!

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:15.552
All right, signal holding.
Just keep steady.

00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:18.096
Holding. Turn right.

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.515
- Right?
- Right! Turn right! Right now!

00:59:28.439 --> 00:59:29.816
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

00:59:31.568 --> 00:59:33.026
Whoa! You're gonna crash!

00:59:33.027 --> 00:59:34.821
- You said right!
- Jesus Christ!

00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:39.325
Stop! Stop! Stop right now! Stop here!

00:59:41.327 --> 00:59:43.787
God damn it! Henderson, what are we doing?

00:59:43.788 --> 00:59:44.997
We lost the signal!

00:59:44.998 --> 00:59:47.332
- Come on. Come on!
- Shit, shit, shit.

00:59:47.333 --> 00:59:48.625
Shit, shit, shit.

00:59:48.626 --> 00:59:51.629
- I got it! It's headed southeast now!
- God damn it.

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:53.464
- Jesus!
- Sorry!

00:59:54.215 --> 00:59:55.215
It's okay.

00:59:55.216 --> 00:59:57.302
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shit!
- Hang on!

00:59:58.595 --> 00:59:59.595
Shit, shit, shit!

00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.346
Jesus Christ.

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:02.514
All right, I've got it.

01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:04.517
- You got it?
- Yes, I got it.

01:00:13.901 --> 01:00:15.319
Why would they turn around?

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.154
Maybe he's trying to shake them?

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:20.033
No, that's impossible.
It doesn't know it's being tracked.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.414
Stay away from me! Stay away!

01:00:27.415 --> 01:00:28.915
No, no, no, no, no.

01:00:28.916 --> 01:00:31.043
I'm so, so sorry, okay?

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:34.254
I'll probably explain this at some point,
but for now, don't move.

01:00:34.255 --> 01:00:36.465
- I thought he ate, like, two slices.
- He did!

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.674
Why is he awake then?

01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:38.885
It doesn't matter.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:40.845
Not anymore.

01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:53.441
We're southeast.

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:55.693
That's why it turned around.

01:00:59.405 --> 01:01:00.740
Vecna's seen.

01:01:01.574 --> 01:01:02.784
He knows where we are.

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:22.238
Hello?

01:02:22.947 --> 01:02:24.198
Henry?

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:26.492
Are you there?

01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:32.915
Henry?

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:31.724
Hi.

01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:57.792
Children behave

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:02.379
That's what they say
When we're together

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:06.007
And watch how you play

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:08.510
They don't understand and so we're

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:11.722
Running just as fast as we can

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:15.935
Holdin' onto one another's hand

01:04:16.602 --> 01:04:19.521
Tryin' to get away into the night

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:21.439
And then you put your arms around me

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.859
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.320
I think we're alone now

01:04:27.321 --> 01:04:31.033
There doesn't seem to be anyone around

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:34.536
I think we're alone now

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:38.708
The beating of our hearts
Is the only sound

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:49.218
Look at the way

01:04:50.636 --> 01:04:53.221
We gotta hide what we're doin'

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:57.183
'Cause what would they say

01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:59.895
If they ever knew and so we're

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:03.899
Running just as fast as we can

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.402
Holdin' onto one another's hand

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:10.572
Tryin' to get away into the night

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.574
And then you put your arms around me

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:15.911
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.580
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:22.584
There doesn't seem to be anyone around

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:25.795
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

01:05:25.796 --> 01:05:30.050
The beating of our hearts
Is the only sound

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:33.261
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:37.058
There doesn't seem to be anyone around

01:05:37.808 --> 01:05:40.518
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:45.273
The beating of our hearts
Is the only sound

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:47.943
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:51.948
The beating of our hearts
Is the only sound

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.325
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:59.413
There doesn't seem to be anyone around

01:05:59.997 --> 01:06:02.958
- I think we're alone now
- Alone now

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:06.128
The beating of our hearts
Is the only sound
