You talked to your dad?

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.170
I'm not as noble as you think.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.410
After everything that happened,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.170
I was actually really sad
and tormented inside.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.690
I didn't know what to do.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.940
So I thought I should leave
the decision to you.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.570
As long as you didn't give up

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.570
and were still willing to be with me,

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.290
I would definitely persevere.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.690
you wanted to give up,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.060
I wouldn't blame you.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.890
But later, your dad came to me.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.060
I thought he made sense.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.570
He did it for your own good.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.410
I could give up everything

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.410
for our relationship.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.540
But I didn't have the right
to make you do that.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.700
I was afraid you'd be with me

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.340
out of pity.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.700
I was afraid that one day

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.410
you'd be unhappy if you stayed with me.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.810
What I feared most was
that you would regret it one day.

and making sacrifices for each other.

didn't make my life better.

The time I spent with you

was the most real life
I've ever experienced.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.170
As soon as he got there,

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.490
it was like he already knew them.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.700
He even told me

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:03.930
he was the big brother,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.220
and they'd sworn

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.290
an oath of brotherhood.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.780
Sworn brotherhood
with an alpaca and a deer?

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.460
Yes. The deer is the second brother.
And then...

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.370
Big brother.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.170

He's the big brother.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.020
He's the big brother?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.660
He's the big brother.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.540
This is the little brother.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.540
He loved it so much.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.290
Look at this.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.660
This.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.290
This is it!

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.050
That day, I...

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.780
Was he playing in the mud?

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.050
No idea. He just kept digging.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.930
Didn't know why.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.340
And he insisted I take a picture.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.290
Do you think it looks good?

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.900
It looks good.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.930
What's good about it?

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.780
You can't even see his face.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.660

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.410

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.610
This outfit.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.540
He wouldn't even take it off to bathe.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.610
For at least a month.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.050
He just really loved this outfit.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.810
Was this the only one?

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:44.410
I don't know he...

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.980
The only one that he wore for a month?

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.290
I need to think about it.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.050
Anyway, this outfit was his favorite.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.410
His favorite.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.290
I don't know what's so great about it.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.340
Thank you.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.900
You've raised him so well.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.810
I feel I owe you both so much.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.140
I'll be even better to you

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.460
and make up

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.460
for all the years we lost.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.050
I'm just so anxious right now.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.980
I want to know every little detail

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.900
about how he grew up.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.810
Come in.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.610

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.610
Any instructions?

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.140
I'm here to inform my project manager

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.490
that Mr. Sun
is hosting a dinner tonight.

Would you like to join us?

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.490
You're the boss.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.980
I definitely follow your orders.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.610
Alright,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.020
after work today,

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.410
I'll go home and get ready first.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.490
Okay.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.410
Wait for me at home then.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.540

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:04.460
Yes.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.930
You've worked hard lately, Zu.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.930
No problem. She worked harder.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.660

for this sports park land

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.770
I need to use the restroom.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.130
Don't drink too much. Don't overdo it.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:43.700
Are you okay?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.820
I'm fine. I'll be right back.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:54.700
Wang Shuhan?

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.940

Back then, we and your brother

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.770
often played marbles
downstairs at your place.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.180
I always lost to you guys.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.530
Now that you mentioned marbles,
I remember.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.180
You're Sun Tiantian?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:21.730
Yes.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.650
Did you transfer

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.530
and then go abroad later?

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.530
We haven't seen each other
in over 20 years, right?

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.940
Yeah. Time flies.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.530
Later,

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.220
because of my father's work,

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.940
our whole family moved to Singapore.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:32.820
In recent years,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.820
we've been having
some business dealings domestically.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.420
So I came back.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.060
Still think it's better here.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.060
Now,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.530
I've started a company here.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.460
What does your company mainly do?

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.420
Investment.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.010
Dabbling in some finance-related fields.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.650
For instance, we invested

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.890
in this sports complex.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.490
Sports complex?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.980
Which sports complex did you invest in?

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.010
The one in East District.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.010
I'm actually managing
the sports complex project

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.940
in East District.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.180
I'm the Project Manager.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:00.940
Really?

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.850
Oh my god. What a coincidence.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.370
Yes.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.340
Zu.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.700
Zu, come here for a moment.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.610
Let me introduce you.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.940
This is Sun Tiantian,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.370
my elementary school classmate.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.420
This is Wu Zuhao.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.850
Mr. Wu from Shengnuo Real Estate.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.130
Mr. Wu, hello.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.250
I've heard so much about you.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:18.770
Hello.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.980
Oh, and here's my business card.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.850
Sun Tiantian from Fengjin Investment?

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.250
Yes.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.610
Shuhan and I
haven't seen each other in years.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.010
Yeah.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.980
Didn't expect
we'd be reunited like this.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.340
What a coincidence.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.130
She's been under
a lot of work pressure lately.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.850
You must take her out more

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:35.730
and let her relax.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:36.940
Exactly.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.650
Since I took on this project,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.940
I've even gotten dark circles.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.420
Not at all.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.850
Still as beautiful as ever.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.770
You're so sweet.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.370
Oh, can I add you both as a friend?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.300
Sure.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.490
You can add me.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:49.940
Okay. I'll scan your code.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.460
I'll send you his contact details later.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.130
Alright.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.530
Such a coincidence.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.580
Yeah. It's really been too long.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.650
Come on, let's add each other.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:10:59.730
Added.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.130
Okay.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.370
I have to get back to my dinner.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.010
I should go.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.580
We're all friends here.
Let's keep in touch.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:08.700
Alright. I won't keep you. Go ahead.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.940
Okay. Bye.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:14.340
So?

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.610
Pretty good, right?

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.220
My classmate is doing really well now.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.610
And she's practically
in the same industry as us.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.370
Alright. Go to the bathroom.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.420
Okay.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.700
I'm going then.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:22.940
Okay.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:24.940
Here.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.300
I really didn't expect

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.250
they'd require the full
registered capital to be paid in.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.610
Sun didn't expect it
to be this serious either.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.650
We've tried every possible way.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.060
We're still short by 20 million.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.370
What do we do now?

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.890
It's okay. We'll figure something out.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:47.700
Zu,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.730
if the registered capital

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.060
isn't fully paid, does that mean

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.530
our project can't start?

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.100
It means we can't break ground at all.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.300
We don't qualify.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.730
It's fine. I'll find a way.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.370
Trust me.
Things will work out eventually.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.770
Speak.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.010
Hey, can't you be a little nicer

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.490
when you talk to your sister?

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.700
Let me ask you,

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.580
do you have 20 million
in your account?

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.770
Lend it to me.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:24.890
How much?

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.580
Wang Shuhan,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.700
have you been kidnapped?

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:29.650
What are you talking about?

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.340
Can you keep your voice down?

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.420
It's just
that my East District project

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.580
needs 20 million more
to get started.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.250
If you have it,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.730
lend it to me.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.300
Do you think I'm a bank?

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.770
What game company

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.850
has that kind of money?

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.530
What about Zu?

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.650
Didn't he secure funding
quite successfully?

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.420
Alright.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.650
Stop. I see.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.820
If you don't have it, fine.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.580
Why ask so many questions?

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.100
If I could borrow it elsewhere,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.060
I wouldn't be calling you.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:56.730
I'm hanging up.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:12:59.850
Unbelievable.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.510
[Sun Tiantian]

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.300
Fengjin Investment will continue
to target overseas markets.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:32.890
Hello, Tiantian.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.060
Well, it's me, Shuhan.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.610
Do you have time lately?

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.650
Let's meet up.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.530
Mr. Wang, it's Shuhan.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.340
Listen,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.010
I have a really great project lately.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.340
If you're interested,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.460
I can tell you about it.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.220
Tiantian, sorry.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.850
I didn't know
you were going abroad today.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.130
I asked to meet on such short notice.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.100
It's fine.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.100
Let's not stand on ceremony.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.580
Besides, I still have time.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.650
And I have nothing else
this afternoon.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.060
So, what's up?

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.420
Here's the thing.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.220
Is there any chance

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.730
you could lend Shengnuo Real Estate
20 million?

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.130
Or, you could lend it to me personally.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.340
I'll write you an IOU

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:14.650
in my own name.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.010
So sudden?

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:18.490
Here's the situation.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.100
It's about that sports complex project

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.580
in East District.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.650
You also invested in it.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.100
We just got notified

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.370
that the registered capital
must be fully paid in

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.420
before the project can start.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.460
So

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.220
it's caught us completely off guard.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.770
I understand its urgency.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.820
And I really want to help you.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.220
If I had 20 million myself,

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.220
I'd just lend it to you.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.820
But as you can see,

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.770
I'm flying to South America tonight

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.610
for our company's currently

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.770
most important

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.580
copper mining project.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.010
Honestly, most of our company's funds

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.650
are tied up in it.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.530
So financially,
I might not be able to help you.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.700
But aren't you an investment company?

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.010
Could you invest a bit more
in this project?

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.580
You know

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.490
the sports complex project

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.370
has huge prospects.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.370
Or,

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.300
would you consider investing
in our company, Shengnuo Real Estate?

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.060
It has great prospects too.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.460
It's a very good project.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.370
There's no doubt about that.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:10.370
But

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.300
before we invest in any project,

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.700
we need to conduct
a professional evaluation

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.610
and determine
a reasonable investment amount.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.100
It's not like going to the market
for groceries.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.610
You can't just decide

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:20.730
to buy an extra pound.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.300
I understand.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.770
Have you contacted the banks?

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.850
Zu has.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.100
But

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.100
we're still waiting for the results.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.890
The registered capital
for a real estate company

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.250
is usually over 100 million.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.820
I understand that.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.100
Shuhan,

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.890
is all the funding

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.100
from your previous financing round
in the account?

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.370
Yes.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.820
But the problem is,

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.340
it's not been fully received

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:49.770
yet.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.650
That's why the project can't start.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.770
We're just short by 20 million.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.460
That's a real shame.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.850
Normally,

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.530
you should use that money
for a short-term investment.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.770
Otherwise, it's a waste.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.850
What kind of short-term investment?

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.180
Are they that profitable?

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.220
Mr. Wu is an old hand
in the real estate industry.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.700
He should be clear about these things.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.370
Actually,

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.610
I didn't tell him I was coming

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.610
to see you today.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.340
Because I want to share
some of his burden.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.850
And I want to surprise him.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.100
Mr. Wu is really lucky.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.610
But Shuhan,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.730
I really don't have

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.300
a suitable project for you right now.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.180
I'll keep an eye out for you, alright?

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.220
Zu,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.730
do you remember

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.820
my classmate, Sun Tiantian,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.460
who we met

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.890
at the restaurant last time?

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.850
She's in investment.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.220
The one in overseas real estate?

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:49.940
Yes.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.490
She just recently returned
to do business here, right?

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.060
Yes.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.820
I think she said
she was in Singapore before.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.300
Lately, they're developing
a mining project in South America.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.580
Mining in South America?

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.940
That's not a small investment.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.660
Given the current economic climate,

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.860
your classmate's got some real guts.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.180
I didn't expect her
to be doing business on that scale.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.380
Do you think we should ask her for help?

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.460
Alright, let's stop talking about work.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.900
I've been thinking,

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.530
we've been too busy with work

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.380
to visit your parents.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.490
How about we find some time to see them

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.620
once things settle down?

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.180
Sure.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.380
I told them about you last time,

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.770
and they really want to meet you.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.090
What do they like?

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.570
I'll prepare some gifts.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.570
Listen,

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.290
you don't need to buy anything.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.090
They'll be happy just to have you visit.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.050
Then

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.220
I'll make the arrangements.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.770
We'll all go out for a meal together.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.290
Let's eat.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.860
Okay.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.940
Le,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.250
Mr. Lu will take you home

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.090
after school today.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.980
Why?

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.980
I've been quite busy lately.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:11.700
Here.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:12.940
Take this.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.860
Okay.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.980
Bye, Grandma.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.490
Bye.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.940
Bye, Mr. Lu.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.620
Bye, Le.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:23.900
Bye.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:28.330
Let's go.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.060
What kind of short-term investment?

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.260
Are they that profitable?

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.220
Mr. Wu is an old hand
in the real estate industry.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.740
He should be clear about these things.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.300
Actually,

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.620
I didn't tell him
I was coming to see you today.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.380
Because I want to
share some of his burden.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.820
And I want to surprise him.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.220
Mr. Wu is really lucky.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.780
But Shuhan,

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.660
I really don't have

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.300
a suitable project for you right now.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.220
I'll keep an eye out for you, alright?

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.300
Tiantian, didn't you just say

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.500
you were flying to South America

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.060
for that mining project?

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.540
Is that project available?

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.740
Can't we invest a little in it?

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.820
That project

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.220
requires a huge investment.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.260
It's not as simple as a sports complex.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.500
And the first round of private funding

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.700
is about to close.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.740
To be honest,

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.060
most of our company's money

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.140
has been invested in it.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.740
And I'm going there now

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.700
for the final preparations
before the launch.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.460
That project is too risky.
It's not suitable for you.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.540
I'll let you know
if something suitable comes up.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.140
Be sure to notify me first thing.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.380
And let me know as soon as you're back.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.940
We haven't had a meal with Yuan yet.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.420
Don't worry.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.220
I will try my best

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.820
to help you figure this out.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.500
Alright.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.540
And thank you for trusting me so much.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.180
I should be the one saying thanks.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:05.940
Tiantian,

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.020
have you arrived in South America?

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.260
If you come across any short-term,

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.540
high-return investment projects,

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.940
do let me know right away.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.180
Shuhan, not yet.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.260
I'll check again after I return
the day after tomorrow.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:43.740
Tiantian,

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.340
about that South American

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.460
mining project you mentioned
before you left,

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.180
could you possibly

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.740
squeeze out a little share for me?

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.020
You know I'm really desperate

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.380
for the money right now.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.100
Can you help me out?

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.660
Our shares are almost full.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.100
And you have to buy it in the name

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:12.740
of a company.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.220
I understand what you're saying.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:16.620
Don't worry.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.260
I'll figure out a way to handle this.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:20.460
Also,

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.260
if this works out,

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.260
I promise your work
won't be for nothing.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.340
Thank you.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.580
I think

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.260
during this process...

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:32.940
Look!

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.140
Many people might...

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:34.900
What are you doing?

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:35.460
back out.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.260
Isn't that... Tan Siting?

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:39.780
Right?

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.620
No wonder she looks so elegant.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.300
You know what?

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.140
I actually had a ballet dream
when I was little.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.660
Stop daydreaming.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.180
Maybe in your next life.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.940
Stop slacking off.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.340
We can't leave
until we finish checking this today.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.860
Finish writing this.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.980
You write it. I'm not writing it.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.500
Fine, I'll write it.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.540
Everyone,

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.860
Ms. Tan's interview

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.380
was extremely successful.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.900
The ratings exceeded our expectations.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.700
Applause! Congratulations!

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.780
I never expected

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.300
such a serious, niche talk show

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.700
to break into the mainstream.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.100
Plus the documentary,

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.540
I've even seen people watching it

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.500
on my way to work lately.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.180
You could say

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.340
Ms. Tan is the hottest ballet star
right now.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.540
Get her autograph now.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:27.940
And

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.660
I just got a lot more calls.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:30.900
Many

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.580
top-tier ballet schools

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.940
want to cooperate with us.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.540
They want to

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.020
send their students here for training.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:38.740
That's really great.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:39.380
Perfect timing.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.940
Ms. Zhuang, you, Ms. Tan,

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.740
and everyone else are here.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.100
These are the top students
who've already sent in their materials.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.260
Each one is exceptional.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:46.900
Come take a look.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.700
It's even more than that.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.020
Several domestic arts festivals

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.900
have invited our students to perform.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:53.620
Here.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.580
Really impressive.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.020
I never thought

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.980
our ballet circle
could get this much attention.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.420
Yeah.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.380
Look.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.260
Ms. Zhuang,

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.820
I have to propose a toast.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.700
As long as the cup is full,

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.700
coffee counts as wine.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.500
Here's to our school's original vision

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.020
finally being realized!

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.580
Bottoms up!

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.780
Ms. Guan,

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.700
do you remember this one?

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.340
From the competition.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:17.660
Excellent.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:18.940
I remember that girl.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.100
This one is good too.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:20.940
Look.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:23.460
Ting.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:24.620
Madam.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.140
We're going to be extremely busy.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.140
It's all thanks to you.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.380
Madam, I plan to return to Paris.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.500
With him?

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.500
What about the child?

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:38.620
Him too.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.540
But it will take a little more time.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.060
For now, I can still handle
the school work.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.140
Alright.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.180
That's a real shame.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:51.740
But

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.660
I'll say it again.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.300
Whatever you decide,

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.820
I support you.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:08.540
Hello?

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.860
Look at that, miracles do happen.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.500
You actually called me?

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.540
Mom and Dad came over last night.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.700
They brought a bunch of groceries.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.020
Your share is here with me too.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.260
Come get it all tonight.
I don't want it.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.100
Okay. Got it.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:20.900
I'm hanging up.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.700
How's that 20 million you mentioned

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.460
coming along?

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.260
Do you still need me
to help you figure it out?

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.020
Now you're asking me?

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:28.940
Let me tell you,

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.580
I found a solution myself.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.260
Oh, Yuan,

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.980
do you remember a neighbor we had

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.620
when we were little named Tiantian?

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.420
The one who always played marbles

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.140
with us

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.340
and kept losing to us?

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:40.980
Remember her?

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:42.860
Yeah.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.580
Didn't she transfer away later?

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.100
Yes.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.820
Seems she's back in the country now.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.780
She started
some investment company here.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.140
What's her company called?

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.300
Fengjin Investment.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.300
And she even said
if there are good projects,

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.500
she'd bring me in on them.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.260
Don't rush into it.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.260
You haven't seen each other for years.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.780
Better to be cautious.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:09.540
Alright.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.100
I get it.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.660
You sound like a broken record.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:12.340
Bye.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.740
Two, three.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:31.980
Go.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.140
Watch your heads.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.420
Heads up. Yes.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.340
Look at yourselves in the mirror.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.340
Hands. Hand positions.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.940
Toes. Point your toes.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.180
Good.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.180
Opposite side.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.620
Not bad.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.180
Watch your calves. Calves.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.460
Tighter.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.740
Hand positions.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.260
Good.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.260
Opposite side.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.700
Heads up.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:00.820
Good.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.940
I need to take this call.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.100
Hello, Dad.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.300
[Payphone]
Ting!

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.780
You finally called me.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.060
Are you okay?
How have you been?

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.500
It's not easy

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.500
for me to get to town.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.180
Today, Dolma and the others
came here to buy things,

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.020
so I tagged along.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.100
I'm doing fine. Don't worry.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.460
How have you been lately?

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.340
I've been good.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:28.860
Oh, Dad,

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.500
I want to tell you something.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.900
Feng Rui and I are back together.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.340
Really?

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.020
That's wonderful!

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.180
I could tell last time.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.540
But you just wouldn't admit it.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.340
That's great.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.420
I wish you both happiness.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.300
Thank you.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.180
[Store]
So,

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.660
what are your plans now?

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.300
France?

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.100
Going to live there?

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.180
Yes.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.020
Because of his mom?

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:03.900
Okay.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.380
As long as you're happy,

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.340
I'll support you no matter where you go.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.260
Dad.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.140
You've been coughing a lot.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.260
I've told you before.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.060
You should go see a doctor.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.860
I'm fine.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.140
Yesterday, I helped a cow give birth.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.300
Probably caught a bit of a chill.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.660
You must take good care of your health.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:31.540
Ting,

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.340
their car is here.
I should head back now.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.460
Next time I get a chance,

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:34.980
I'll...

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.420
I'll come to town and call you.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.100
Don't worry.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.100
I'm doing just fine.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.180
You take care.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:43.740
I'm hanging up.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:56.140
Zu,

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.620
what if we use the money we have on hand

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.540
for some

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.100
high-return short-term investments?

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:02.940
Shuhan,

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.260
all investments carry risk.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.380
The company can't afford
any risks right now.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.420
But delaying the construction timeline

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.740
is also a risk.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.420
Thank you for sharing the burden.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.820
But the company
will have some project payments

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.060
coming in within the next two weeks.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.780
So I asked Sun

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.540
to wait a bit longer.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.380
Don't worry.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:23.740
I'll get back to work.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.460
Shuhan,

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.060
I managed to squeeze out a spot for you.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.700
An institution is currently looking

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.660
to acquire our first-phase equity fund.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.660
I'll figure out a way

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.980
to get you an early payout from it.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.060
It shouldn't take more than a week.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.500
Tiantian, it's me.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.340
I got your message.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.420
Thank you so much.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.860
You really did me a huge favor.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.740
Here's the situation now.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.460
I'm short by 15 million.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.100
So, how much do you think

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.340
I should invest in that project

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.100
to earn back the money I need

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.180
in the shortest time possible?

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.700
That would require an investment
of 7.5 million.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.300
And the sooner, the better.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.460
Because we're about to close the round.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.340
7.5 million.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:20.940
Yes.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.620
I remember you said

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.460
that we had to sign in the name

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.580
of a company.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.540
You need this urgently,

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.140
but our company
has a lot of regulations,

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.300
so signing the contract

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.940
might take too much time.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:34.900
Alright.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.940
Because you need the money urgently.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.940
We actually aren't supposed to
operate that way.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.380
We'll definitely need
a company contract later.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:43.900
No problem.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.500
Tiantian, thank you so much.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.780
When you're back in the country,

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.620
I'll treat you to a proper feast.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.260
You're welcome.

I'm returning tomorrow.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.860
Think it over.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.260
Transfer the money to me by tomorrow.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.180
No need to wait that long.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.820
We've been classmates for so long.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.900
This afternoon will do. Wait for me.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:08.500
Ms. Sun.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:08.860

Oh,

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.180

your balance information.

It should be fine.

Hello, what's up?

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.460
I looked into your classmate

Sun Tiantian's company.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:54.460
Something seems off.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.540
What do you mean, off?

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.540
This company
isn't registered domestically at all.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.460
It's a major international company.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.340
An international company, understand?

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:05.540
The company is based overseas.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.380
And many overseas companies

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.580
are now investing

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.420
in domestic projects.
What's so strange about that?

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:11.380
No,

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.620
if she's doing business domestically,

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.380
shouldn't she register the company here?

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:16.700
Let me tell you,

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.140
that is a major international company.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.460
It's huge.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.100
They even invested

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:22.860
in our sports complex project.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.060
I had to beg and plead

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.420
just to get a tiny share

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.300
to do business with them.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.660
Stop being so paranoid.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:31.620
Wang Shuhan!

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.780
Haven't you been burned enough
over the years?

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:35.900
You're nearly 40 years old.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.420
Aren't you familiar with these kinds

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.300
of "scam a friend" schemes by now?

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.700
I'm just giving you a friendly reminder.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.540
I'm worried you'll get cheated!

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:44.620
All these years...

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.380
"All these years" again.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.420
Can you stop saying that?

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:49.580
Listen,

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:50.500
I promise you

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:51.780
this is the last time.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.900
I'm absolutely doing things properly

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.140
this time.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:55.860
Okay?

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:56.700
I'm hanging up.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:01.980
It'll definitely be fine.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:09.540
Tiantian,

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.500
I've got everything sorted on my side.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.700
I'll wait for your news then.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.040
[Yuanxin Bank]

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:18.940
So,

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.660
you could say you've contributed

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.540
to Ms. Zhuang's school.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:22.820
I suppose so.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.060
The happiest part

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.620
is contributing to the dance world.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.420
I'm feeling a bit proud.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:31.700
Ms. Great Artist,

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.740
may I have the honor

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.340
of taking you out for a meal?

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.460
I happen to be free tonight.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:38.900
How about

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.860
we pick the most expensive restaurant?

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:42.460
Sure.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:43.580
You choose.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:44.500
Lin.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:45.700
Yes, go ahead.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.700
Please take us
to the nearest Cantonese restaurant.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:53.700
The recommended destination

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:54.940
is 10.5 kilometers away.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.300
Shall we go there?

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:58.820
That's a bit far.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:00.700
The traffic is terrible.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.620
How about

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.660
eating at home instead?

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.460
Your place?

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.100
Le isn't home these couple of days.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.100
We can have some time
for just the two of us.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.340
Then find the nearest supermarket.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.300
Okay.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.900
Go to the nearest supermarket,

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.060
then head home.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.940
Found the following navigation route.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:26.900
Ready to go.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.580
We had a deal.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.420
You're the chef tonight.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:32.860
Okay.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:33.620
You can be my assistant.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.180
Okay.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.140
Bye, Mr. Lu.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.020
Okay. Bye.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.260
Bye.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:46.260
Bye.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:54.780
Okay.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:56.700
Let me help you.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.300
Alright. I've got it.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.420
Can you carry that?

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.260
Tonight, we're cooking...

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.940
a feast.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.100
Come in.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.980
Have a seat. I'll wash the vegetables.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:26.660
Okay.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.060
Let me show you around.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.020
This is Le's room.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.420
Take a look.
I'll go wash the vegetables.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.380
I'll help you.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.900
Alright. Then you shell the peas.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.420
Who is it?

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:07.860
Le.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:13.340
Le.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:15.780
You're back.

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:18.860
Ms. Tan?

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:19.620
Le.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.140
Weren't you at Grandma's house?

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.140
We thought you were staying
at Grandma's.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:28.820
Are you two

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.780
dating?

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.900
When did it start?

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:40.660
Dad.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.860
We should be honest, right?

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:44.380
Yes.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:46.900
Do you remember

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.580
my last business trip

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.540
to Hongyuan County
in Aba Prefecture, Sichuan?

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.620
That's when it started.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:53.740
Le,

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.460
are you unhappy that your dad and I

00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.500
are dating?

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.540
Actually, whether he dates or not
doesn't really concern me.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.260
But Ms. Tan,

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.900
why didn't you tell me?

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.340
It's not that I didn't want to tell you.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.340
I've been completely open with you.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.820
I've told you everything.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.140
But why did you keep hiding it from me?

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.740
It was my dad's voice
on the phone that day,

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.260
wasn't it?

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.660
But you told me it was your colleague's.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.820
I'm sorry I lied to you.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.940
If I hadn't found out myself,

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.380
how long were you planning to
keep hiding it from me?

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:33.780
Ms. Tan,

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.180
I considered you my best friend.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.260
But you just see me as a kid, don't you?

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:41.260
I...

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.140
Ms. Tan and I

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.700
always wanted to tell you.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.540
We just wanted to find

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.980
the right time.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:51.540
Ms. Tan,

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.780
you've always known me well.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:55.980
Or

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.260
did you deliberately get close to me

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.340
and become friends with me

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.140
just for my dad?

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:04.460
Feng Lexuan!

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:06.700
We

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.300
never intended to deceive you.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.420
The situation is just a bit complicated.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.700
We had our reasons for not telling you.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.420
Do you remember when I gave you a...

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:16.900
Le,

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.060
this

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.020
is my fault.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.900
I shouldn't have kept things from you.

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.660
I apologize.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.580
But just now you said

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.780
I got close to you because of your dad.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:33.620
I swear

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.260
that's absolutely not true.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.860
I hope you can believe me.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:18.620
Here.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:42.860
Tiantian,

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.380
I remember
you're returning tonight, right?

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.100
I'll pick you up from the airport then.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.340
Let's have dinner tonight.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:53.860
Something came up last minute.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.460
I might need to stay here
for a few more days.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:56.460
It's fine.

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.100
Well,

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.220
focus on your work.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.340
Let me know

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.500
as soon as you're back.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.260
I'll pick you up.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.660
Here, have some more.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.180
Okay. I know.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:13.300
Oh,

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.380
I have a business trip to Shanghai.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.020
Contact me anytime

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.220
if anything comes up at the company.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.900
What could possibly happen
at the company now?

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:21.940
I'm just

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.060
waiting for our project to start.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.220
I'm going on this trip

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.420
to get the project started faster too.

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.340
I know.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.820
By the way, how long will you be gone?

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:35.900
I'll be back within a week.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:37.580
A week.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.780
I'll have a surprise for you

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.100
when you get back.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:42.780
What surprise?

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.940
If I told you now,

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.220
would it still be a surprise?

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:47.940
Now you've got me

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.460
looking forward to coming back
before I've even left.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:50.940
To your surprise.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:51.380
Here.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:52.420
- Cheers.
- Okay.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:00.420
Oh,

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.580
what was the name of the friend
or classmate

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:04.260
you mentioned the other day?

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.380
Tiantian? Sun Tiantian.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:07.700
Sun Tiantian.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.460
Didn't I mention her at the company?

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:09.940
Yes.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.860
When we met her that day,

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:12.460
she said

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.100
she invested
in our sports complex project.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.980
I think she did say that.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.300
That's strange then.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.100
I went to Sun from Tongjie today

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.580
specifically to check the investor list.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.380
I didn't see that name.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.780
For such a large project,

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.180
she probably couldn't invest
as an individual, right?

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.820
But I didn't see the name Fengjin

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:33.380
either.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.580
Not even the company name?

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.180
That can't be right.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.260
Maybe she wants to invest
but hasn't yet.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:51.740
Zu, take your time eating.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.220
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.940
Tiantian, have you decided
when you're coming back?

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.340
Don't you think his behavior
is a bit off today?

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.660
His attitude

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:22.620
wasn't what I expected.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.980
You mean him suddenly

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.740
asking if we're dating?

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:31.860
It's been 12 years, after all.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.580
He's never had a mom.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.340
If we suddenly tell him

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.020
I'm his mom,

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.660
can Le accept it?

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.340
So I'm wondering

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:43.860
if we should

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.700
wait for a more suitable moment

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:46.980
to tell him?

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:50.060
Okay.

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:51.740
Whatever you say.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:53.780
And you said

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.700
he'd stay at your mom's
for a couple of days.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.580
Why did he suddenly come back?

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:05.140
Never mind.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:06.180
Go upstairs now.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.140
Le is home alone.

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.100
I'm leaving.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.540
Alright.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.100
Be careful on your way.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:12.380
Let me know when you get home.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:12.780
Okay.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:15.100
Go upstairs now.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:15.740
Buckle up.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.300
Let's go, sir.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:17.860
Ready, sir.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:19.300
I'm leaving.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:21.620
Let's go, sir.
