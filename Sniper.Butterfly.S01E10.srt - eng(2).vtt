00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.850
Wow, they're so clean.

00:03:14.044 --> 00:03:15.622
These sneakers aren't cheap, right?

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.410
Fake ones?

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.688
Or did you get them

00:03:24.022 --> 00:03:27.610
through some shady way?

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.610
Put them down.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.570
My hand slipped.

00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.288
You'll have to wash them again.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.340
Pick them up.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.044
Didn't you tell me to put them down?

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.730
What if I don't?

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.410
Pick them up.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.850
I'm not.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.500
Pick them up!

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.380
I'm not!

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.933
Why are you barking at me?

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.500
Huh?

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.130
Why?

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.222
Trying to start a fight?

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.220
Come on. Hit me.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.610
Go on.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.660
I...

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.060
They're fighting!

00:04:13.577 --> 00:04:14.666
What are you doing?

00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:18.660
You're really fighting?

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.610
Li Wu!

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.630
Hit me!

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.580
It's been days.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.444
When are you going to

00:04:31.488 --> 00:04:32.288
apologize to Li Wu?

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.460
I need to show my sincerity.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.660
I can't apologize empty-handed.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.177
I have to prepare something.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.730
You're so slow.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.244
Someone's fighting!

00:04:42.755 --> 00:04:44.020
Someone's fighting? Let's go.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.290
What's going on?

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.780
Take a look.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.333
Which class?
They're really fighting?

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.580
I'll call you later.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.900
Not here.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.140
Over there.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.730
Li Wu!

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.460
Move.

00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:00.140
What's wrong with you?

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.140
Cheng Rui!

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.020
We're helping you!

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.311
Why are you siding with him?

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.250
Don't use me as an excuse.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.066
Whatever issues we have are between us!

00:05:08.088 --> 00:05:09.911
Who do you think you are?
How dare you hit him?

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.290
So we were wrong helping you?

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.250
Screw you!

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.810
Cheng Rui.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.250
You!

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.410
Get off!

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.020
Cheng Rui!

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.780
You two!

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.980
You hit me, huh?

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.780
Hit me if you dare!

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.220
You!

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.250
Let go.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.730
Let go!

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:28.020
Let go! All of you!

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.850
Let go!

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:31.644
What do you think this place is?

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.580
Fighting here?

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.733
You're completely out of line.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.930
Everyone, out!

00:05:47.977 --> 00:05:49.266
Look at what you've done.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.422
What are you staring at?

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.700
Mr. Qi, they were the ones
who started hitting Li Wu.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.170
Quiet.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.410
Did I ask you?

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.700
Did I tell you to speak?

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.730
Li Wu.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.100
You tell me.

00:06:21.733 --> 00:06:23.888
They've been bullying him
this whole time.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.020
What do you mean by that?

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.460
Weren't we helping you?

00:06:27.644 --> 00:06:29.200
Didn't this all start because of you?

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:29.600
Enough.

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:30.170
Mr. Qi...

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.730
Come back.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.540
Mr. Qi, I believe

00:06:33.577 --> 00:06:35.133
there must be some misunderstandings.

00:06:35.155 --> 00:06:36.850
My son is naughty,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.170
but he would never

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.220
bully anyone.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.020
He gets along with everyone.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.100
That's right.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.340
I've never heard of my son

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.250
having conflicts

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.410
with anyone.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.170
How could he suddenly get into it

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.100
with a new student?

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.730
Who's bullying

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.020
whom

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.410
isn't clear yet.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.490
Mr. Qi,

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.100
can I know

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.980
what exactly happened?

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.140
Alright.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.730
Last night,

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.930
the boys

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.980
had an argument

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.580
in the pantry,

00:07:04.622 --> 00:07:06.311
and then they started fighting.

00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:07.933
Luckily, the injuries were minor.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.610
Otherwise,

00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:09.844
it would've been serious.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.020
Why were they arguing?

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.220
Kids fight. That's all.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.850
Did I ask you?

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.700
You didn't,
but I'm still going to say it.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.980
Look at what this boy did

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.930
to my son.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.020
His eyes are swollen.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.340
I'm telling you,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.900
I know they're still young.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.569
Out of kindness, I suggest
they both take a step back.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.150
What happened?

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.222
You're not grateful at all.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.660
Out of kindness,
or because you feel guilty?

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:34.700
You know it yourself.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.460
You!

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.780
How can you talk like that?

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.000
What's that supposed to mean?

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.930
Alright. Enough.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.370
Parents,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.460
we'll stick to

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.850
the facts here

00:07:42.955 --> 00:07:44.088
and resolve the problem.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.700
About what happened last night,

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.850
I've spoken to the other students

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.140
and found out the truth.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.250
Over the past few weeks,

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.050
Zhang Jiaqi

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.340
and Gao Yiqiang...

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.490
You two have been
doing inappropriate things

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.170
to Li Wu.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.730
Some boys from your class

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.220
who are close to you

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.370
were also involved.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.540
I'm telling you now.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.020
This is

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.340
serious.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.290
And I'm certain

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.980
you two

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.250
started it.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.580
Mr. Qi, when did this begin?

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.460
According to the students,

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.980
about half a month ago.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.410
Why didn't you

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.170
tell me about this?

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.050
Mr. Qi,

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.540
let me say something fair.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.180
If a whole group

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.610
targets one person,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.220
there must be a reason.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.490
What era are we in?

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.250
Why are you

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.250
victim-blaming?

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:41.850
Wait.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.850
Who are you?

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:44.580
Really.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.420
Why didn't the parents come?

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.850
We need to talk to the parents

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.940
face-to-face.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.370
Why is someone

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.650
this young here?

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.250
Seriously?

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.340
I'm his older sister.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.730
Mr. Zhang,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.850
Li Wu's situation

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.060
is special.

00:08:58.222 --> 00:08:59.890
We can't ask about his parents, right?

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.300
Then that explains everything.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.460
No proper family upbringing.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.650
Who knows

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.770
what kind of person

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:08.580
he'll grow up to be?

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.980
You made that conclusion

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.890
just from what a few students said?

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.180
Look at how unreasonable
you're right now.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.610
I can't imagine
what a good person your son is.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:19.850
What's wrong with my son?

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.770
His eyes are small, yeah.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:22.730
Look at his injuries.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:23.700
My goodness.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.911
You think you're in the right?

00:09:24.933 --> 00:09:25.580
I'm warning you.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.580
Stop being so snarky

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.460
and unreasonable.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.100
Who's being snarky here?

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.377
Everything can see it.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.100
Li Wu,

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:43.420
look at me.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.180
Lift your head.

00:09:49.133 --> 00:09:50.711
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:51.933
Why are you looking down?

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.060
The injuries on his face

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.822
are enough for a medical report, right?

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.130
You stand here

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.266
pretending to be righteous
while pushing the blame.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.250
I sent my brother here to study,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.610
not to be bullied.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.850
There are cameras everywhere.

00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:12.300
Many students saw what happened too.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.770
Getting evidence shouldn't be hard.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.100
They must give Li Wu

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.060
a public apology.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.220
If I ever find out

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.511
anyone bullies my brother again,

00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:22.666
I'll call the police.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.650
Mr. Qi, I'm sorry.

00:10:35.955 --> 00:10:37.355
I'm taking him outside for a bit.

00:10:42.022 --> 00:10:42.610
Cheng Rui.

00:10:42.933 --> 00:10:43.700
Where are you going?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.220
Wait here. I'll be right back.

00:10:45.488 --> 00:10:47.266
Help me say something nice
to the teacher.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.180
I'm Li Wu's sister.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.650
Let me make this clear today.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.530
If anyone in this class

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.250
bullies my brother again,

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.820
I won't let it slide.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.250
I'm sorry, Miss.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.355
You can continue morning reading.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.060
Silence.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:42.730
Let's resume class.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:43.850
Cen?

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.890
What happened?

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.610
I'm sorry, Mr. Qi.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.100
I couldn't hold it in.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.340
I really couldn't stand

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.955
seeing them bully my brother like that.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.060
I'm truly sorry.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.300
I honestly didn't know

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.220
he'd endured so much

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.250
this whole time.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.530
He's had a hard life
since he was little.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.300
I didn't think he'd still suffer
like this after coming here.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.111
I feel like it's all my fault.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.530
I didn't help him enough.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.060
But...

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:23.580
I can promise you.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.940
Li Wu is a good student.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.180
He behaves well and works hard.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.180
He's very, very hardworking.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.850
Mr. Qi, I promise you.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.460
I personally guarantee

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.300
that Li Wu is a good kid.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.660
(Li Wu. Class ranking: 2nd)

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.250
I moved up.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.340
I dropped again.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.820
Li Wu, well done.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.580
You're second in the class.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.777
Forty-third in the grade.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:04.700
Forty-third?

00:13:04.733 --> 00:13:06.000
You improved that much?

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.488
Did you sign up for a tuition class?

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.490
Come on.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.180
Li Wu.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.340
Come out for a sec.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:14.420
Come out.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.100
You say it.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.340
You said it for me just now.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:21.980
Say it yourself.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.890
You finish it for me.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.490
- You're already here.
- I didn't prepare.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.066
Don't push me.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.460
Say it yourself. Come on.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.729
- Hurry up. You say it.
- Hurry.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:28.600
Just finish it for me.

00:13:28.644 --> 00:13:29.133
He's here.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.340
Li... Li Wu.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:36.700
I'm sorry.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:42.890
I misunderstood you before

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.700
and caused you a lot of trouble.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.940
I'm really sorry.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:48.890
I... I actually...

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:49.420
It's okay.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:53.940
Really?

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.610
When Mr. Qi looked into it,

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.066
the three of you spoke up for me.

00:13:57.066 --> 00:13:57.733
I remember it.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:58.820
Thank you.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:00.980
Don't say that.

00:14:01.088 --> 00:14:02.340
The whole thing was our fault.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.940
If it weren't for us...

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.610
Anyway,

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.940
if you need anything,

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.850
just ask us.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:08.610
No need to be shy.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:12.770
Li Wu.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.890
Are we still friends?

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:18.340
Of course.

00:14:20.666 --> 00:14:21.800
I'll treat you guys to a meal.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.420
Let's go outside
and have something good.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.066
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:24.850
No need.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.530
Just listen to him.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.850
If he doesn't treat you,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.250
he'll feel guilty.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:29.770
Yeah.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:30.490
It's been so long

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.370
since we ate together.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.610
- Let's go.
- Come on.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.580
Let's go.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.490
- Come on.
- Let's go.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.060
What do you guys want to eat? Seafood?

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.300
Whatever you like.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:37.980
You choose.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.530
For real?

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.130
Yeah.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.180
- Let Li Wu choose.
- You choose.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.730
- What do you want?
- I'm fine with anything.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:42.460
Anything?

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.250
Don't.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.190
I'll pick, then. I want lobsters this long.
Let's get two.

00:14:45.244 --> 00:14:45.844
In your dreams.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.610
Li Wu, what's on your mind?

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:14.850
Look who's here.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:17.940
Lin Xue?

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.010
Li Wu.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.060
Have a seat.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.444
Lin Xue's starting at the office today.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.200
You're her senior.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.555
You didn't even come to pick her up.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:30.688
Were you so busy with work?

00:15:30.688 --> 00:15:31.700
Yeah, I forgot. I'm sorry.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:32.850
That's on me.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.770
I'd told Wu

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:35.890
when I'd be here,

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.133
but I got held up

00:15:37.155 --> 00:15:38.700
by some school procedures.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.066
That's why I only made it now.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.010
Li Wu,

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.340
tonight I...

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.420
Who is this?

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.010
She's a new intern,

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.890
Lin Xue.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:50.850
I told you all before.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.300
She was my junior at Penn.

00:15:52.844 --> 00:15:53.820
She graduated this year.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.650
She's very capable.

00:15:54.844 --> 00:15:56.240
I'd like Zhang Chenyang to guide her

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.044
so she can get familiar
with our work sooner.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.610
This is Mr. Yi.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:00.980
He handles

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.490
financing and risk assessment.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.530
Mr. Cheng is

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:04.010
our CEO.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.650
Mr. Cheng. Mr. Yi.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.370
Nice to meet you. I'm Lin Xue.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:08.700
It's an honor

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.130
to join your team.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.890
I'll work hard

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.220
and adapt quickly.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:13.850
Alright.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.250
Since you're his junior,

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:16.700
we're all family here.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:17.820
Work hard.

00:16:17.866 --> 00:16:19.800
If you have any questions,
come to me anytime.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.340
Go finish your onboarding first.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.311
I'll take you to the tech department
this afternoon.

00:16:24.355 --> 00:16:25.644
Okay. Thank you, Wu.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.610
Our company's blessed, huh?

00:16:33.088 --> 00:16:34.180
Not only has your advisor

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.250
become our consultant,

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.644
but your junior has also joined us.

00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:39.177
Say, I actually came
to talk to you guys.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.700
Do you remember

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.650
Mr. Qin from last time?

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.340
I've almost convinced him,

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.370
but he hasn't drafted the contract.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:46.730
He's probably hesitating.

00:16:46.844 --> 00:16:47.850
So I arranged a dinner

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:48.700
for tonight.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.940
You both have to come.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.770
Don't talk too much about tech
at dinner.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.130
Talk about the industry's future

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:55.820
and outlook,

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.420
especially return on investment.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.180
Investors love that.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.890
Let's try to seal the deal tonight.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.290
Got it.

00:17:05.133 --> 00:17:06.530
I'll do whatever you need me to do

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.700
to get funding.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.570
You lead the talk tonight.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:11.570
We'll back you up.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:16.770
Okay.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.290
I'm so sorry.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.010
The last meeting

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:23.980
ran long.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.660
Mr. Qin, you're very busy.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:26.940
We're grateful

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.770
that you made time

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:29.330
for dinner.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.290
Right, Mr. Qin.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.490
Thank you for coming.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.050
Someone new?

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.180
Let me introduce you.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:37.250
Lin Xue.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.329
Li Wu's junior
from when he studied abroad.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:40.620
She's also from Penn.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.330
We brought her along

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.490
to learn from you.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.090
Your company

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:46.700
has so many talents.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.860
You flatter us, Mr. Qin.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.140
Lin,

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.010
that's a compliment for you.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.660
Come, offer him a toast.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:55.770
Yes.

00:17:58.533 --> 00:17:59.900
I'd like to toast to you, Mr. Qin.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:00.460
Sure.

00:18:06.244 --> 00:18:07.533
You hold your liquor well, Lin.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.940
Didn't your senior tell you

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.250
that a toast is three cups?

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.570
The dishes are so slow.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.730
Lin Xue, could you nudge the kitchen?

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.133
Mr. Qin.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:25.900
It's an honor

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.700
that you value

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.860
our company.

00:18:28.288 --> 00:18:30.155
You can rest assured
about the technical side.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.490
We won't let you down.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.380
Yes, Mr. Qin.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.010
You have

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.090
far more business experience

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.250
than we do.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.290
We'll be counting on your guidance.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.333
Please look out for us.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.250
I'll toast to you.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:39.700
Here.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.177
Alright.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.600
Please look out for us.

00:18:46.844 --> 00:18:47.777
Drink as you wish.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.420
I read

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.770
your proposal.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:59.860
The AI environment project

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.180
is good,

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.420
but can you lower the development cost

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.290
a bit?

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.844
As long as it works, that's enough.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.700
If you focus too much on innovation,

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.460
it'll hurt

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.770
the overall returns.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.660
Mr. Qin, here's the situation.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.620
It's mainly because

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.860
AI has a promising prospect right now,

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.620
so competition in this field

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.620
is extremely fierce.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.900
If we settle for

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.700
what we have now,

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.050
we'll be overtaken

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.380
by our competitors very quickly.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.050
We have to keep updating

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.380
and upgrading our system.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:35.940
It's also a way

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:36.900
of securing our future.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.940
That's how we maximize returns.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:43.620
If we put money

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.490
into the future,

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.980
there's always uncertainty.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.460
But if it goes into our pockets now,

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.530
then we can rest easy.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.570
Yes, right.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.940
Let's take that as your blessing.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.010
May we earn

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.220
that money soon.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.770
Come. I'll drink to you.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.330
Sure.

00:20:01.155 --> 00:20:02.066
Drink as you like.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:03.220
As you like.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.666
I look forward to our collaboration.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:05.420
Cheers.

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:24.220
I haven't had such fresh yellow croaker
in a long time.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.730
This is delicious.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.088
How did you find this restaurant?

00:20:27.111 --> 00:20:28.900
Chun Chang loves trying new places.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.290
Anything she recommends

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.010
is usually good.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.460
It really is good.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:38.460
Actually...

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:41.940
You don't have to be so polite.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.330
It wasn't your fault

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.444
you stood me up last time.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.420
You were stuck in traffic
on a rainy day, hungry,

00:20:47.511 --> 00:20:49.422
and even took on an extra patient
because of me.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.900
I should be the one treating you.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.460
Do we have to keep things that clear?

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.900
Good friends keep business clear.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:05.420
Alright.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.290
What's that?

00:21:12.377 --> 00:21:13.622
I forgot to ask you earlier.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.777
I forgot to take it off.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.490
I did a free clinic today.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.140
I saved a little girl,

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:22.955
and she gave me this.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.620
You're so busy with work.

00:21:25.622 --> 00:21:27.155
You still have time for free clinics?

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:28.380
Yeah.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:29.330
I'm really busy.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:30.900
I barely have my own life

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:31.940
or free time.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.940
That's why I'm still single.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.090
Finding someone

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:39.730
who can support and understand you

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.180
isn't easy.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.010
I get it.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.090
I'm running a company

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:46.980
with my partner.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.140
For me,

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.660
work comes first.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.330
The energy I can give

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.860
to family or other things

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.660
is limited.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.810
But luckily, we're pretty similar.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.010
We both find fulfillment

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.180
in our careers.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.010
So even if some things

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:05.460
aren't perfect,

00:22:05.844 --> 00:22:07.220
we can still live a happy life.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:09.980
Yeah. Pretty similar.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:11.570
Here.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.010
Thanks for the meal.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.400
You're welcome.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.420
By the way,

00:22:22.222 --> 00:22:24.133
I brought some strawberries back
from the trip.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.140
When you leave later,

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.140
take some home.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.090
No need. You keep them.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.933
It's fine. There's a lot.
I can't finish them.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:31.700
Alright then.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.290
I'll take some.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.250
Come on, eat.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:36.290
Mr. Qin,

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.700
you hold your liquor so well.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.220
Don't worry.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.090
I'll draft the contract when I get back.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.530
Mr. Qin, thanks for your trust.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.140
Let's wish for a smooth cooperation.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.180
Yeah.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.530
Good. Happy cooperation.

00:22:53.733 --> 00:22:55.040
- I'm off.
- We'll get going now.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.220
Take care.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.330
Okay.

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.530
I'll arrange a golf game in a few days.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.980
Show me

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.810
how you break 80.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:02.810
Sure thing.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.490
Drive safe, Sir.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:06.860
Take care, Mr. Qin.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:08.330
Bye-bye.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.420
Yes!

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.090
Our Series B funding

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.380
is in the bag.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.330
Those drinks paid off.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.140
I still think

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.570
Mr. Qin's vision

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.330
doesn't match ours.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.620
Matching or not doesn't matter.

00:23:33.666 --> 00:23:35.190
As long as someone's willing to invest,

00:23:35.288 --> 00:23:36.511
we grab the chance. Right?

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:38.810
But...

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.770
He might not be
the right investor for us.

00:23:44.733 --> 00:23:46.000
Maybe we should keep looking.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:47.860
Seriously?

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:49.660
Mr. Li,

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.570
we're looking for investors,

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.980
not shopping for clothes.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.490
You say that way too easily.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.140
I see now.

00:23:56.222 --> 00:23:58.140
You think Mr. Qin doesn't
understand technology.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:58.810
He's an outsider.

00:23:58.866 --> 00:24:00.590
But he's giving us money.
That's all we need.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.940
Yes, he's giving us money...

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.050
Only with money

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.700
can the company expand.

00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:06.490
Speeding up commercialization

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.660
is our most realistic choice right now.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:09.660
Plus,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:10.330
the contract

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.380
is almost in hand.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:12.180
You...

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.220
Why can't you keep your options open?

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.220
He's giving us money soon.
Why wouldn't we take it?

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:16.730
Alright.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.730
Let's not argue at the entrance.

00:24:19.133 --> 00:24:20.088
We've been drinking.

00:24:20.111 --> 00:24:21.290
We'll talk at work tomorrow.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:22.980
Du.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.180
Drive Mr. Yi home.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:25.770
Okay.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.066
He's drunk and probably
feeling awful. Drive slowly.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:28.822
Let's go, Mr. Yi.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:32.980
Wu, Mr. Cheng.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.860
My ride is here.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.050
I'll head back.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:37.220
Okay.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:37.700
Be careful.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.730
Get home safe.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:39.730
Text when you're back.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:40.420
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.700
I'm neutral.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:56.180
Ideal,

00:24:56.933 --> 00:24:58.622
yes, Yi needs to consider that.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.330
But we have to

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.250
look at reality.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.140
Think it over.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:35.090
That's a lot.

00:25:35.466 --> 00:25:37.022
I'll help you carry them upstairs.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.010
Close the trunk.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:42.700
Okay.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:44.420
Thanks.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.380
Let's go.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:58.460
Hold on.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.010
Sister.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.330
Dr. Lu.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:13.460
Hello.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.050
Did you drink?

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.010
I had a business dinner tonight.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.940
Why did you come back

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.250
with Dr. Lu?

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.140
Today I...

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:39.770
Cen Jin

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.220
invited me to dinner.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.066
I'm helping her
bring some fruit upstairs.

00:26:50.533 --> 00:26:52.050
You two live in the same building?

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:54.290
He just...

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:54.700
Yes.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.940
She helped me find the place.

00:26:57.355 --> 00:26:58.844
I live right across from her.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.900
By the way, your test results are out.

00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:10.090
I'm on duty next Monday.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.333
Can you come for a follow-up?

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:13.380
Sister,

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.380
are you free on Monday?

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.660
The follow-up won't take long.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:22.700
If you're busy,

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.220
I can send you the report.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:33.700
I...

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:35.180
I'll see what I can do.

00:27:35.266 --> 00:27:36.400
I'll let you know later.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.700
Excuse me.

00:28:13.022 --> 00:28:14.330
You can put them on the table.

00:28:15.244 --> 00:28:16.460
I'll put them in the fridge.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.420
Thanks.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:36.140
Here.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.220
Have some water.

00:28:40.311 --> 00:28:41.700
There are a lot of strawberries.

00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:43.730
They might spoil even in the fridge.

00:28:44.266 --> 00:28:45.688
Do you know how to make jam?

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.940
No.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:51.730
It's still early.

00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:53.530
I can help you make some.

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:56.644
Wouldn't that be too much trouble?

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.666
Can you stop being so polite?

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:01.770
Okay.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.380
Shen.

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:17.860
Come here.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:18.490
Gather around.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.420
Come on.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.050
Let me introduce

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.180
our new members.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.140
Chun Chang,

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:26.770
Yang,

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:27.250
and Yi.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.660
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.050
Why are you here?

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.980
Maybe it's fate.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:35.250
What's going on?

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.180
You two know each other?

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.330
We've met.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:40.700
We've met twice,

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.010
and we talked a bit.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:44.980
Twice?

00:29:45.666 --> 00:29:47.290
How come I never heard you mention it,

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:47.860
Shen?

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:48.980
Don't be nosy.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.555
Get ready with the gear.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.460
I only knew

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.730
you were good with a scalpel.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.530
I didn't expect

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.155
you'd be just as good with a spatula.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.810
It's almost done.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.530
Taste it.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.133
Careful. It's hot.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.330
How is it?

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:32.460
Should I add some sugar?

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.090
No, it's just right.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:36.860
Do you have a secret recipe?

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.769
This tastes better than the ones
they sell outside.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:39.570
Not really.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.570
When you cook jam,

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.010
you have to watch the heat.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.530
If the temperature
is too high or too low,

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:46.940
the texture changes.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.530
And what you need to do

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:50.530
is to keep stirring.

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:52.220
It's training your patience.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:54.050
Luckily,

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.570
my patience is pretty good.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.250
I've slowed down a lot

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.140
these years.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:15.810
If it were before,

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:16.730
I'd have thought

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.420
this was way too troublesome.

00:31:18.533 --> 00:31:20.177
I'd rather buy one
from the supermarket.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.380
It only takes ten minutes.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.770
But things you make yourself

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.250
taste different.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:32.940
Aren't you tired of stirring?

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:33.940
Let me take over.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.660
Sure, give it a try.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:38.730
It's simple.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.940
You never mentioned Li Wu before.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.290
Looks like you two are tight.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.311
We've known each other
for quite a while.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.180
Add a bit of lemon.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.220
Then stir it, and it's almost done.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:16.940
Okay.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.700
Why hasn't he left yet?

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.380
(Cen Jin)

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.266
Oh right.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:48.860
Once they cool,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.377
put them in the fridge.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:51.220
Okay.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.100
(Cen Jin)

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:03.860
Hello?

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.010
Hello?

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.290
Hello?

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.660
Yes?

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.900
Well... I wanted to ask...

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.460
Are you free

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:29.980
next Monday?

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.422
Can you go to the hospital with me?

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:35.619
Let's do it in the morning.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.050
I'll go with you for the appointment,

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:37.888
and then head to work.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:41.730
Okay.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:42.330
Alright.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.250
Done?

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:48.180
Let's go.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:22.260
Anything else?

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.090
Yes, I...

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.210
I'm out of drinking water.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:29.780
Can I borrow some?

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.610
Is a small bottle okay?

00:34:58.610 --> 00:34:59.090
Yeah.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:02.900
Thanks.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:07.740
You just

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:08.940
made these?

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.170
Dr. Lu made them.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:13.466
I don't know how to cook this.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.090
Don't you

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.380
prefer sour flavors?

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.111
Are you okay with something this sweet?

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.900
It tastes fine to me.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:45.740
Anything else?

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.690
No.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.210
Go rest then.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.170
Okay.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.490
Mr. Xiao said

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.530
you do social media

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.260
and you're good at taking photos.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.170
My skills are average.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:40.260
I just started the social media stuff.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.050
My main job

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:44.090
is running a bar with my friend.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.460
Xiao Jun told me

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.050
that our group

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.900
always struggles to find a venue.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:51.740
We discussed it.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.044
I can give you guys

00:36:53.111 --> 00:36:54.170
a private room at my bar.

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:55.570
Room's free.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.570
Drinks are at cost.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.780
For real?

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.050
That's great.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.090
We finally

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.490
have a place.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:03.210
Exactly.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:04.820
If we go

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:06.300
on our own,

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.460
can we get a discount?

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:09.610
It depends on

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:11.570
how deep our friendship goes.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:12.860
How big a discount

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.650
can I get?

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.900
You're all asking her

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.610
so many questions.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.050
Let the lady

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:19.820
ask us something.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.690
Yes.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:21.777
Ask us something.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.420
I only have two questions.

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.300
First.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:28.490
Are you single?

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.130
- What's going on now?
- What?

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:43.090
I'll answer for him.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:44.300
He's single.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:44.780
Yeah.

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.460
He's single.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:45.900
Right?

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:47.170
- Yes.
- Yes. He is.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.010
Yes.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:49.130
Okay.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.940
The second question.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.170
Why haven't you accepted

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.780
my friend request?

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:58.010
Shen.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.530
Seriously?

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.610
How many things

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:01.820
are you two hiding from us?

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:02.690
Exactly.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.780
He's keeping us in the dark.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.490
You said

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:07.955
you don't add strangers on WeChat.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:08.690
But we're

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:09.860
not strangers anymore.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.860
We're in the same group now.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:13.900
We'll be seeing

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.530
each other a lot.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.730
Yeah. Accept the request.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.650
She's already said it.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:19.110
Accept it.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:20.130
Come on, Shen.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:20.860
Quick.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.300
What's wrong with you, Shen?

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.044
A beautiful lady sends you
a friend request,

00:38:24.066 --> 00:38:24.911
and you don't accept?

00:38:24.955 --> 00:38:25.490
Accept it now.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:26.888
- What's gotten into you?
- Quick.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.220
(Chun Xiaoxi)

00:38:32.555 --> 00:38:33.530
He accepted the request.

00:38:33.688 --> 00:38:34.490
He finally did now.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:35.490
That's more like it.

00:38:35.644 --> 00:38:37.666
Looks like the rest of us
have no chance anymore.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:38.860
You really dare to dream.

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.300
Bro...

00:38:40.266 --> 00:38:41.177
Get over yourself.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:41.610
Come on.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:42.980
Let's drink.

00:38:43.133 --> 00:38:44.750
- Let's drink and don't be upset.
- Cheers.

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:45.444
Cheers.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.260
Cheers.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:06.210
Beautiful.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.740
We're off, Mr. Shen.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:13.210
Bye-bye.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:13.530
Alright.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:13.980
Bye-bye.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.170
Get up. Let's move to another tent.

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:56.170
I just

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.690
got into my sleeping bag,

00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.650
and you drag me out.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.090
What do you want?

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:14.820
Let's switch our tents.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:16.940
Why?

00:40:18.355 --> 00:40:19.530
The wind is strong at night.

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.010
Your tent is too thin.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:21.980
He's afraid

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.130
you'll get blown away.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:29.690
If so, I'll take your tent.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.570
This is too small.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:43.888
You sleep here yourself.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.610
I'll squeeze in with someone else.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:25.460
(Chun Xiaoxi's Moments)

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.090
You're still up.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:38.610
Are you boiling water?

00:41:41.022 --> 00:41:42.022
I'm going to bed now.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:52.260
