00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.140
You're already at the hospital?

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.970
What time did you get there?

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.240
I just got here a little early.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.310
So Eun Oh is letting you stay in the room?

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.180
She doesn't know I'm here. I can see the room from here.

(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.550
Man, you must be on pins and needles.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.790
Hey, when she goes into surgery, tell her I'm rooting for her.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.830
I'd be lucky if I even get a chance to say anything.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.200
I don't know what it'll be like on the morning of the surgery,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.670
so I'm not sure if I can just pop in.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.100
Right, I get it.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.170
You could go to work and see her after the surgery is over.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.780
But I still want to see her before the surgery...

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.250
and wish her luck.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.250
Then just go in there and wish her luck.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.220
I'll handle it.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.160
- I'm hanging up. - Hey. Tell me how it goes.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.590
Will do.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Yes?

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.600
Sir.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.830
The Chairman's Chief Secretary is on the line.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.770
Dad!

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.180
I'm not dead yet.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.340
Dad.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.180
(Shoealls)

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.650
Did you call him?

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.780
I told you to let me rest.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.190
Fine, get back to work.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.090
- Yes, sir. - Oh, boy.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.760
Dad, we need to go to the hospital.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.730
It was just a dizzy spell.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.930
I heard you were staggering. That's why you need to go.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.770
My blood pressure probably spiked from dealing with President Choi.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.070
What are you, a doctor?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.540
It might not be your blood pressure. It could be your brain.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.410
You need to take your age into account.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.480
Stop treating me like I'm an old man.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.550
I had a full checkup just a few months ago.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.950
I got a clean bill of health.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.490
If you keep refusing,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.190
I'm calling Mom.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.870
How can we get to Nebrance? I have so much to review today.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.770
Then let's go to Cheong Ah Hospital. It's close by.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.540
Let's go, Dad.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.670
All right, fine.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.980
He's been feeling dizzy on and off since yesterday afternoon.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.650
- No underlying conditions, correct? - Right.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.590
A few days ago,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.690
there was a business matter that really got my blood boiling,

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.960
and I got a bit heated.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.960
- Let's start with a brain CT, then. - Well...

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.800
I already had a brain CT at my checkup a few months ago...

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.830
Dad, just get the scan.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.400
Are you satisfied now that you dragged me here for this?

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.240
The new product's reception, the restocking schedule...

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.010
There are a million things I need to handle.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.880
The new product isn't more important than your health, Dad.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.390
Playing the dutiful son now?

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.420
Anyone watching would think you're the son of the year.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.690
I may not be the son of the year,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.890
but I'm still your son.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.170
The doors are closing.

(Cheong Ah University Hospital)

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.130
You got this.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.640
He saw me.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.760
What's this guy doing?

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.570
Excuse me, surgical patient. Elevator priority, please.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.610
It's just one floor. Let's take the stairs.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.670
Yes, let's do that.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.650
Hang in there.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.910
But why would Dad come to the hospital?

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.710
And with Seong Jae, no less.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.450
By the way, how are you so quick on the uptake?

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.980
I completely froze.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.990
I don't know. I just had a feeling Ms. Ko shouldn't get caught.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:53.890
You're right.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.020
If my dad finds out Mom lied to him, he'll be so shocked...

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.630
No, it'd be more than just a shock. He'd never accept it.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.200
My family would be completely torn to shreds.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.440
But Ms. Ko recognised me earlier.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.540
So what if she did? You're the one who saved my mom.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.910
That's right. I did save her, didn't I?

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.280
Hey, we're in the clear. We really are.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.490
Right now, you're basically my mom's lifesaver.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.260
Maybe this will clear up her misunderstanding about you.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.860
Come on, "lifesaver" is a bit much.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.700
If there's one thing my dad hates, it's being lied to.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.040
And the only person he trusts completely is my mom.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.440
So what if the Chairman had seen your mom back there?

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.080
What would've happened?

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.810
At the very least...

Our Eun Oh is having a major surgery.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.900
I'm too nervous to just sit in her room.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.240
She'll be okay, right?

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.740
She'll be fine.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.720
Good luck with your surgery.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.920
Excuse me, one second.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.330
I'm sorry.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.670
It's okay.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.240
Everything's going to be okay.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.410
Okay? Don't you worry.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.640
My goodness.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.750
Right this way, please.

(Operating Room)

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.720
Could he have come here because he knows something?

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.990
Or is he just sick?

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.690
If he's sick, he might be looking for me.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.900
He might even come here to find me.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.570
No, what makes you so sure there were no calls for me?

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.400
Didn't you go to the restroom?

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.640
Check the incoming call log.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:24.970
Right away.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.210
If he were sick enough to call,

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.080
he would've called my cell first.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.560
Maybe he got sick at work?

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.660
Why not go to his own doctor? Why that hospital, of all places?

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.870
Luckily, we found nothing wrong. It seems to be from too much stress.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.540
See? I told you I was fine.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.080
I swear, this kid gets worried over nothing.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.780
What are you talking about, sir? Once you're over 60,

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.180
you need to get checked immediately at the first sign of a problem.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.220
Why are you giving such a caring son a hard time?

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.150
Was I giving him a hard time?

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.090
So you're saying the dizziness could just be from stress?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.860
- Yes. - Are there any other possibilities?

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.130
You don't need to worry.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.360
You heard him. I'm all clear.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.570
(Outpatient Clinic)

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.400
So, there's nothing wrong with me.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.170
This was such a waste of time. I'm exhausted, kid.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.080
It's a good thing that nothing's wrong, Dad.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.480
Looks like Dad just had a checkup. I guess it wasn't anything serious.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.250
Yes, that's a huge relief. He's not even being admitted.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.320
Gosh, I'm so exhausted.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.360
- Let's get out of here too. - Yes, let's go.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.500
Hi, honey. What's up?

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.430
His voice sounds perfectly fine.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.370
So it was nothing serious.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.240
Honey, you said you had plans tonight, right?

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.440
If that hasn't changed, I think I'll make my own plans.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.250
No, nothing's changed. But it's not like you...

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.780
to make plans at the last minute.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:15.920
What?

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.320
Wait, your voice sounds a little off.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.820
Are you feeling okay? Are you sick?

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.520
It's like you're psychic.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.660
- It was nothing, but Seong Jae... - Dad.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.060
- Yes. - I'll go get the car.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.330
Honey, tell me what was wrong. Okay? Start with that.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.140
It was nothing. I just felt a little dizzy,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.940
but Seong Jae dragged me here for a CT scan.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.510
- Nothing's wrong. Satisfied? - My gosh. You gave me a scare.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.220
But what did they say was the cause? What did Dr. Han say?

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.750
Oh, Nebrance was too far,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.690
so we came to Cheong Ah Hospital since it's closer.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.430
Thank goodness Seong Jae took you there right away.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.630
Okay, got it. You should go back to the office.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.440
I panicked for nothing.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.570
So exhausting.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.940
Han Woo Jin's surgery will take more than eight hours.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.010
We'll send you a text when the surgery is over.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.280
Honestly, if something was wrong, he should've gone to his own doctor.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.590
Does Seong Jae just drag his father to any old hospital?

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.800
Eun Oh, please...

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.540
Please...

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.110
Ji Eun Oh's surgery is complete, and she is now in the recovery room.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.220
She'll be moved to her room in 1 to 2 hours.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.250
She's been recovering for an hour and a half.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.420
I wonder why she's not back yet.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.160
Mom? They said her surgery went well,

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.760
so why are you still praying?

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.730
I can't rest easy until I see her myself.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.070
She's just so frail.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.500
I wonder if he feels the same way.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.570
That guy from this morning... He's been here this whole time.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.480
- He's been here this whole time? - Yes, I see him by the restrooms.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.550
Really?

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.950
Do you think they might be dating?

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.750
No, I doubt it.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.220
If they were, why would he be hiding and fretting like that?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.790
Patient Ji Eun Oh is on her way from the recovery room.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.560
She is? Thank you so much.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.040
- This is the nurse call button. - Okay.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.640
This controls her pain medication. If she seems in pain, press it.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:57.880
Yes, I understand.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.250
She'll likely sleep for the rest of the day.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.180
Okay. Thank you so much.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.720
Yes, thank you.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.160
Eun Oh, sweetie.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.590
You went through so much.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.560
You must be in so much pain.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.100
You did so well.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:31.910
Hey, you.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.710
Yes.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.220
My sister just came back to her room from recovery.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.320
Mom asked me to let you know.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.190
How is she? She's back? Did the surgery go okay?

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.650
Eun Oh's all right, isn't she?

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:42.990
Yes, everything's fine.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.860
But don't even think about trying to see her. She's asleep.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.200
I don't need to see her.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.860
As long as she's okay, it's all good.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.570
Good. Now you can go.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.030
You're making everyone uncomfortable.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.540
So stop hovering around within 30m of her room.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.570
All right, I get it, kid. See you tomorrow.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.140
Gosh, you...

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.480
He's coming back tomorrow?

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.490
Did you stay until she woke up?

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.260
They said she made it back to her room safely.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.160
You should try and reach out to her later.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.100
Mr. Lee.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.300
I have updates for you on HQ feedback...

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.900
and the week's schedule.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.200
Perfect timing. Come on in.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400
Yes, sir.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.640
He was at the hospital all this time and didn't even get to see Eun Oh?

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.520
So, from working together on the AP acquisition,

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.250
I felt we were really in sync.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.450
Would you be interested in working more closely with me?

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.690
Don't tell me you already knew I was going to ask this.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.200
See? This is exactly why I wanted to keep it a secret.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.600
Okay, then I'll just ask you straight out.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.200
The IT team is on solid ground now. As Assistant Manager of Planning,

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.770
would you be willing to be my right-hand man?

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.640
So, kind of like an executive assistant.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.610
It's not just about managing my schedule.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.980
I need someone who understands me and can help run the core business.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.180
A key player.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.750
You knew I was going to say yes, didn't you?

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.420
I had no idea.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.290
I thought you knew how much I admire you.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.400
Didn't you say you had an update for me?

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.480
Doctor, how is Woo Jin?

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.810
The surgery went well. He's in the ICU now.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.680
My gosh. So he's going to be okay, right?

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.990
Well, the surgery went well, but he's in the ICU,

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.490
so we need to monitor him for at least a week.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.660
But you can breathe a little easier now.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.790
Thank you so much, Dr. Jin.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.030
You should go home and get some rest now.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.540
He's over the worst of it.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.560
Good grief.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.690
To think he was fooling around like that.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.530
Mom, you're back.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.270
What?

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.980
Mom, you must have been so shocked at the hospital earlier.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.280
That was a really close call.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.820
By the way, why was Dad at the hospital?

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.420
He didn't see you, right, Mom?

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.530
That driver of yours blocked me so he wouldn't see me.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.900
Ji Wan is so quick on his feet, isn't he?

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.770
But what were you doing there anyway?

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.740
It was the day of Woo Jin's surgery,

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.340
so I wanted to cheer him on, even from afar.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.180
By playing make-believe doctor with that loser?

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:29.220
What?

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.250
Mom, how can you say that?

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.550
We're the ones who saved you!

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.860
Wrong.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.430
You were saving yourself.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.830
If the truth about Woo Jin got out, our family would be destroyed.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.470
You're well aware of that, aren't you?

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.840
That's why he hid me away.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.870
You know your life would be a mess if your dad and I divorced.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.510
I'm tired. Get out.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:14.690
(Lee Sang Hoon, VP of Jinhwa Pharmaceuticals)

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.360
My gosh.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:20.330
Hello?

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.070
Hello, ma'am.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.710
This is Lee Sang Hoon, VP of Jinhwa Pharmaceuticals.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.940
Yes. Vice President Lee.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.920
I just had a feeling Ms. Ko shouldn't get caught.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.760
You're right.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.230
If my dad finds out Mom lied to him, he'd never accept it.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.630
If there's one thing my dad hates, it's being lied to.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.230
So what if the Chairman had seen your mom back there?

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.940
What would've happened?

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.740
At the very least...

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.270
Divorce?

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.280
Did Mom really read my mind in that moment?

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.850
Then what does this mean for my deal with Mom?

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.490
(Thank you.)

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.330
Ha Eun, I just wired you your share. Check your account, quick.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.030
For real?

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.530
Su Bin, are we really making some serious money now?

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.940
I told you! It's the "grandma effect," right?

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.110
I can't argue. Things took off after we raided Grandma's closet.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.210
Jo Ok Rye's Senior Model Challenge.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.810
We'll give Grandma half the profits from this.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.950
Of course. I even have the cash envelope ready.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.550
(Thank you.)

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.990
An appearance fee?

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.130
Not all of it. Half is spending money from me,

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.360
and the other half is your YouTube appearance fee.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.200
Wow, this is a thick envelope. Are you sure this isn't too much?

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.840
Grandma, I'm giving it to you because you've earned it.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.810
You think I'd just give you everything I make?

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.840
You're really making enough to be giving me money?

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.710
I sure am. And it's mostly thanks to you.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.350
Grandma, if things go well, I might start Ok Rye Entertainment.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.890
A management agency specialising in senior models.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.060
My gosh, what are you even talking about?

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.730
- Make some sense. - For now, go on a spending spree.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.960
Starting next month, I'll deposit your YouTube fees directly.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.130
What did you say?

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.540
- Grandma. - Yes.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.040
Can you teach me how to make that porridge?

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.740
Your porridge is way better than Mom's.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.710
Ji Hyuk, why porridge?

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.880
Stop!

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.750
Okay.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.290
All right.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.330
Just who is this amazing girl...

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.670
for you to make her thin rice gruel, not even regular porridge?

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.810
Man, this takes forever.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.080
Of course, it takes time to make thin gruel.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.810
What kind of surgery did she have?

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:27.190
My eldest grandson's partner has to be healthy, Ji Hyuk.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.260
She's perfectly healthy, Grandma.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.160
Don't worry.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.990
Don't worry.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.930
Hey, honey.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.430
You really have no idea who she is?

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.170
Who on earth is this girl making our son act like this?

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.840
I wonder too. He must really like her.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.010
That's not liking, that's just crazy.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.420
Right. You never make me porridge. You only buy it, never make it.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.150
Exactly! That's what I'm saying. The boy's gone crazy.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.690
Good grief. Next thing you know, he'll be making her rice balls.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.460
Making porridge, or gruel, or whatever it is. Unbelievable.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.830
My gosh. I'm so curious to know who she is.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.300
And he says they're not even dating.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.440
I thought she'd at least say, "Thank you for saving me."

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.740
I didn't help her expecting a thank you.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.450
Besides, she's not going to break our deal, right?

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.850
You mean, about firing you?

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.290
I was worried at first too, but she can't do that.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.320
She'd have to tell my dad to do that.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:38.890
Then I wouldn't stay silent either.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.360
Exactly.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.300
Anyway, now that we've seen Woo Jin through his surgery,

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.630
let's just focus on our series.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.900
- Okay. - What do you feel like drinking?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.570
An iced Americano? Or matcha?

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:52.810
An iced Americano and a scone.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:57.310
- Got it. Lock up after me, okay? - Okay.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.940
What the...

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:34.580
Darn it...

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.790
What's wrong with your leg?

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.830
I almost died just now.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.600
What happened?

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.270
Some crazy guy on a motorcycle was swerving and nearly hit me.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.210
If I weren't a PE major, I'd probably be dead right now.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.280
Hey, you're really scraped up.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.180
We need to disinfect that. I'll get supplies from the pharmacy.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.260
Hey, where do you think you're going by yourself?

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.660
Besides, I already put together a first aid kit.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.900
You did?

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.800
You should have said so earlier.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.910
Where is it?

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:39.650
- Ouch, hey. - Hold still. I have to apply this.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:19.590
Looks like So Ri and Dokgo Chan are finally getting some rest.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.350
Yes.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:24.990
Remember first seeing the house? I told you I loved this alley.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.490
I've been thinking about it ever since.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.290
This alley is gorgeous, isn't it?

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:31.330
It really is.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.010
Why does this keep getting in the way?

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:42.470
What does?

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.640
Your hair.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.320
All this time...

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.590
I'm sorry for always yelling at you about not living your own life.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.130
Where is this coming from?

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.530
It must've been so hard on you.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:07.270
I've only been judging you by what I could see.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.100
Since I knew nothing about Director Ko.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.170
How did you get through it all?

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.750
You're just like Dokgo Chan.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.010
I am?

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.350
You know how Dokgo Chan is.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:30.090
He's blunt and a man of few words, but he cares so much about So Ri.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.360
Come to think of it, you two are exactly alike.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.200
It's not like I was trying to copy his character.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:41.400
I know.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.270
I looked in the mirror earlier. I thought I looked fine.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.640
So why is everyone standing there staring at me?

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.450
You've got some colour back.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.550
The surgery must've gone well.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.690
I don't know why,

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.420
but I'm just so moved, Eun Oh.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.190
Did the surgery go well for him too?

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.860
He's in the ICU right now.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.340
He's very lucky to have a friend like you.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.880
Eun Oh, what did it feel like when you woke up after surgery?

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.480
What was the first thing that came to mind?

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.010
When I opened my eyes,

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.190
I thought, "I'm alive."

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:15.820
Of course.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.790
It's an incredible thing to be alive.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.030
You're right.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.000
Being alive...

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.800
was truly an incredible feeling.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.070
You have to be alive to do anything, after all.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.540
I guess that's why our hearts keep beating.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:38.010
That's so true. When you really feel alive,

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.080
your heart just pounds, whether you're excited or startled.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.750
Then, thanks to me,

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.090
you all got to feel what it's like to be truly alive today.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:52.090
We sure did. Thanks to you, Eun Oh.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.200
- Let's get going. - Already?

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.270
Already?

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.040
Come on, we've checked on her. Eun Oh needs her rest.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.510
Let's go.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.250
- Hello. - Hello.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.720
- I brought some rice gruel. - Okay.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.190
Could you please give this to her when she's allowed to eat?

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.790
- Okay, I will. - And if anything comes up,

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.590
- please call this number. - Okay, will do.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.660
Rice gruel?

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:33.500
I'm heading out.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:05.230
Su Jeong, I'll meet you at the car. I just need a word with Ji Hyuk.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.360
Okay.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.510
What's wrong? You can't tear yourself away?

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.610
I think I'm starting to see why people get married.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:21.810
What do you mean by that?

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.380
With all that Eun Oh's been through recently,

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:29.790
I found myself thinking, "What if I were her husband?"

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.560
Then I could be there for her through thick and thin.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.700
- Right now, I can't do anything. - I know what you mean.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.570
So I guess that's why people get married.

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:45.870
(Lee Su Bin)

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.880
Hey, pick it up.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.720
It's nothing. I don't need to get it.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.750
What's with you, Park Seong Jae?

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.790
What? Why?

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.120
Are you seeing someone?

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.760
Seeing someone? Don't be ridiculous.

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.830
Come on, what is it then?

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.860
Who is it? When are you going to introduce us?

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.530
Not just yet.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.030
"Not yet?"

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.570
No, wait... I have a bad feeling about this.

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.940
Don't tell me you're in love with someone you shouldn't be.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.050
There's no such thing as a forbidden love.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.850
Then why say, "Not just yet?"

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.650
It's just... I can't tell you anything yet.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.160
Look, just drop it. What's your deal?

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.300
What was that?

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.430
Why is Park Seong Jae being so serious?

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:47.770
What's with him?

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.190
Park Yeong Ra.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.570
Is there something you wanted to talk about?

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.880
Any news on that driver?

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.510
- Excuse me? - The bodyguard, Lee Ji Wan.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.950
Why are you suddenly asking about Ji Wan?

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:42.920
Because I have my reasons.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.070
Oh, no. Why are you shaking like that?

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.870
You look like you have something you want to ask me.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.970
Did you...

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.010
Did you do something, Mom?

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:05.310
Do what?

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.250
Did that bodyguard of yours get hurt or something?

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:11.120
I almost died just now.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.290
If he did, I'm sure it was just a coincidence.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.430
Accidents happen all the time.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.100
You see it on the highway signs all the time.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:31.540
Some crazy guy on a motorcycle was swerving and nearly hit me.

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.240
"Number of traffic fatalities today."

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.950
Not a single day goes by without someone dying.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.750
- Mom. - Yeong Ra.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:50.020
You think I'd let my dear daughter be with someone so beneath her?

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.290
Did you really think I'd just let it go?

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.860
Did you think I'd let that punk have my precious daughter?

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.440
Either you die, or he does.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.340
So, who should it be?

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.510
Mom...

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.810
How could you?

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.050
We haven't even done anything...

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.120
Because it's obvious what you're going to do.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.590
I heard from Vice President Lee Sang Hoon.

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:23.920
He wants to keep seeing you.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.660
So that's what this was about.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.430
You know how people are.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.230
When they have a brush with death or a close call,

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:37.000
they think, "I dodged a bullet. I need to be more careful."

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.640
Perhaps, what your bodyguard went through...

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.210
was probably a lucky warning, don't you think?

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.880
To appreciate how precious his life is.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.750
How did it come to this?

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.680
Get a grip, Lee Ji Wan.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.120
Snap out of it. She's Seong Jae's sister!

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.150
It's cold.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.360
Ji Wan.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.300
I'm not going out today.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.130
I have a cold.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.730
You should rest at home, too.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.140
And don't go wandering around just because you have the day off.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.400
Just rest at home.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.440
A cold?

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.410
She must have been outside too long in the cold yesterday.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.850
Is it a bad cold?

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:32.550
Are you feeling really sick?

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.990
Wait, could it be...

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.060
because of what happened yesterday?

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:43.960
(Is it a bad cold?)

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:56.510
All right.

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.710
If you think you need to see a doctor,

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.450
call me right away. I'll be waiting at home.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.120
What am I going to do?

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:18.830
What is it?

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.600
Yeong Ra has a migraine, so she's staying home today.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.230
She asked for some painkillers.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.870
Make sure she has some soup first.

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.080
I can read her like a book.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:51.600
I told you not to take medicine on an empty stomach.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.600
Mom.

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.570
There's something I need to tell you.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.510
What? When you're feeling so sick?

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.110
Tell me tomorrow.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.350
Actually...

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:12.320
I've been working on a webtoon.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.820
A webtoon?

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:17.320
You mean, like a comic?

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.120
Yes.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.930
I've been working on one by myself for a while.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.960
And I've been having so much fun with it.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:26.930
And then...

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.900
You even signed a contract?

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:34.470
Mom.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.910
Please, can't you just let me finish this one webtoon series?

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.350
So you've been lying to me this whole time.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:42.680
You two have been lying to me all along!

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.120
Mom, please.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.890
Two months. Just give me two months.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:54.230
It's just that I really want to see this through to the end.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:57.760
Just let me do this one thing, and I'll do whatever you want.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.000
I'll even meet Vice President Lee Sang Hoon again.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
And marry him?

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:06.500
I'll at least meet with him.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.410
I'll give it a real shot.

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:10.240
So please...

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.980
Can't you just let me finish publishing this series?

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.080
She's gotten all these wild ideas in her head.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:25.360
The contract with Neiro isn't even in your name.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:30.630
It's still my creation. I'm the artist.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.230
I'll pay the cancellation fee. Have your driver handle it and quit.

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:35.830
Mom!

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.240
Get up. You're going to scrape your knees.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.810
Why can't you just let me do this one thing?

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:50.380
I'm on my knees begging you, and you can't give me two months?

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.350
I'm begging you. Why won't you let me?

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.050
Finish it for what?

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.720
You think two months is a short time?

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.490
You think I'm going to let you spend two more months with him?

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.230
Then I'll...

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:04.430
tell Dad about Woo Jin.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.460
And you think I'll just sit back and do nothing?

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.630
That will just make me even angrier at him.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.070
Go on. Tell your father.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.100
Yes?

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.540
How are you feeling?

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:49.170
- I'm feeling better. - You said you could eat porridge.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.210
You brought all this?

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.250
Wait, did your mother make all of this?

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.280
No, it's a recipe from my grandmother.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.820
I made it myself.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.220
- No way. Really? - Yes.

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:05.190
Here, let me open it.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:32.150
I have the flu.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.990
I can't go to the studio for a while.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.270
Yeong Ra.

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:59.110
You're not trapped in your house, are you?

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.380
No, it's not like that.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:06.620
She said she was sick,

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.650
but she posted it right on schedule.

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.050
(Episode 53, New)

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.910
You have a meeting at HQ today.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.510
Can you postpone that?

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.610
I'd advise against going.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.280
Excuse me?

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:45.360
Oh, Mr. Lee. I just spoke with Eun Oh.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.390
She's been discharged and is on her way home now.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:49.330
I see.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:02.410
I'm just really happy you're recovering so quickly.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:04.380
Mom, I told you.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.910
- That I'd get better fast. - You're not fully recovered yet.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:12.680
You need to take it easy at home. Get plenty of rest.

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:14.950
I will.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:17.390
By the way...

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.320
How's Woo Jin doing?

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:22.760
He's still in the ICU.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:26.260
They'll move him to a regular room in a few days.

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.040
Hello.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.940
Mother!

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.340
My gosh, Seong Jae.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.310
What brings you here?

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:41.050
I heard you got a new job, so I had to stop by.

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.410
- Here! - Gosh, thank you.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.650
I see. Well...

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.020
You look great.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.420
Oh, I do?

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:57.560
Yes. You look healthy and vibrant, and you seem so much brighter.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Has something good happened to you?

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.370
It's because I feel so good to be here.

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.600
I can see you and buy Grandma a gift.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:06.670
A gift for Grandma?

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.670
But your grandmother passed away.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.580
I mean Ji Hyuk's grandmother.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.810
She's finally made her debut as a model.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:15.350
She'll have to keep practising her walk, so...

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:18.680
Oh, I thought it'd be nice for her to have one of these at home.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.150
My own grandfather used to use this product.

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:24.460
You're getting a gift for my mother-in-law?

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:29.660
Mother, I can afford it. Father can use it sometimes too.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:32.860
I'm holding off on getting you one because I'm worried...

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.130
Ji Hyuk might yell at me.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.370
I'm sure she'll love it.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.740
She said it helped relax her muscles and improve her circulation.

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:44.610
Great, then...

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.740
could you ring this up and arrange for delivery, please?

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:50.210
Yes, here you go.

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.980
Thank you.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.850
- Good work today, Da Jeong. - Thank you.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:59.360
Seong Jae. I'm getting off work now. Do you want to have dinner with us?

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.660
Yes, I'd love that.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:09.800
We're here with the mega-successful senior model, Jo Ok Rye,

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.370
filming a slice-of-life scene for her grand finale.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:17.240
Grandma always makes rice in a pot instead of a rice cooker.

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:20.080
And it tastes absolutely amazing.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.420
Almost there.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:29.090
Grandma, look over here.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.190
So cute.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.260
- Grandma, I'm here! - Well, look who it is!

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.760
It's Seong Jae.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.530
Oh, it's good to see you.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.340
- My gosh, hi. - Hello, have you been well?

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.400
Yes, of course.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:47.970
Hey, Su Bin. Hi.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:50.170
Hi, Seong Jae.

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.210
Mother, you've already started dinner?

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.180
I told you we'd do it together.

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:57.780
Making the rice and stew isn't a big deal.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.890
How'd you know Seong Jae was coming? You even made doenjang stew.

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.350
Seong Jae, we're having doenjang stew...

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:04.420
with spicy pork and squid.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.390
Doenjang stew too? What a feast!

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.740
No, I'll contact you when I'm ready.

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:24.440
She said she'd contact me when she was ready,

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.380
but I haven't heard from her at all.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:30.180
Gosh, did something actually happen to her?

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:33.680
This is driving me nuts.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.220
No way...

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:50.030
Wait, was Yeong Ra mad about what happened that day?

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.840
No, that's not it.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.810
We were totally fine afterward.

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.250
Maybe she went home and had second thoughts?

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:04.480
Just say something.

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.420
Please, just tell me, Yeong Ra.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.020
Ji Wan, dinner's ready.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:14.020
I'm not hungry.

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:16.530
But Seong Jae's here. We made spicy pork and squid.

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.600
Seong Jae is here?

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:33.640
Ji Wan. You've got a few days off, so why don't you take a trip?

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:34.950
Why have you just been staying home?

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:38.280
I might get called in anytime. How can I go anywhere?

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:42.750
Hey, by the way, is something wrong at your house?

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.990
No, nothing special. Why? What's up?

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.230
Is this about Yeong Ra?

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.760
She seems to be really sick with a bad cold.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:58.400
So she's actually sick.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.070
What a relief.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.610
Seong Jae, how's the spicy pork and squid?

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:06.980
Is it as good as you remember?

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:09.510
Of course.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.120
And my doenjang stew?

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:14.750
I want to take a whole pot home, Grandma.

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:17.220
You're such a sweet talker.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.060
Su Bin, why are you so quiet over there?

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.200
I'm busy eating.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.880
This is delicious.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.950
That was so delicious. Thank you so much, Mother, Grandma.

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:52.060
You're such a pleasure to cook for.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.530
Don't be a stranger. Come by more often.

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:57.260
I will, Grandma. I'd better get going.

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:04.300
Oh, I completely forgot about that.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.240
I'm just off to the stationery shop. I'll be right back.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.640
Right, my jacket.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.890
Hey, gosh.

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:38.670
Why did you go to Mom's store without telling me?

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:43.110
I bought a gift for your grandma.

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:47.310
The mat Grandma wanted to get for your dad.

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:52.220
Buying just 1 for him felt weird, but I worried 2 would be a burden.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.550
So I got one for them to share.

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:56.990
You remembered that?

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.390
You think I bought it just because you said so?

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:04.260
I was already thinking of a gift for Grandma's modelling debut.

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:07.200
I can't believe how thoughtful you are.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.940
Hey, what are you doing? We're right in front of your house.

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:15.640
Because you're adorable.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.610
Oh, my goodness.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.750
I had a hunch and came out to check, and I was right.

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.080
Grandma, it's...

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:29.290
- I'll explain everything. - Explain what? That you're dating?

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.930
Go around the corner if you're going to do that.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.600
Someone's going to walk by and see.

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.070
Grandma.

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.980
Grandma. How long have you known?

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:00.550
You said you were filming me,

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.590
but you were busy giggling and texting.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.190
At the fashion show, I saw some guy who looked just like Seong Jae,

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:10.760
staring holes right through you.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:12.500
And it really was Seong Jae.

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.770
So is that why you left by yourself that day?

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.430
Because of me and Seong Jae?

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:19.700
No, that's not it.

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:24.380
You two were acting so suspicious at dinner that I followed you out.

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:27.980
So are you against us, Grandma?

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:34.390
You are adults who like each other. It's not my place to approve or not.

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:39.220
Besides, I've always liked Seong Jae.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.490
He's a good kid.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:42.030
Really?

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:45.000
- Oh, dear. - That's my grandma!

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:48.170
- You're so happy. Gosh, stop. - Thank you.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.410
Eun Oh, have some fruit.

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.040
Okay.

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:07.790
Oh, boy. All I do is eat and rest.

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:10.190
I'm really living the high life.

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.290
This must be hard on you, Mom.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:14.790
Having to care for me all the time.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.600
You haven't rested in over ten years ever since your dad passed away.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.670
So how could this be hard on me?

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:27.370
Seeing you rest makes me so happy, no matter what led to it.

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:31.310
I just want to keep feeding you and watching you sleep.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:34.210
Let's put some meat on your bones, my sweet girl.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:36.210
Here, eat up.

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:38.720
My gosh.

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.170
Yeong Ra.

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:58.270
I said I'd call you when I got here. Why are you waiting out in the cold?

00:53:58.770 --> 00:53:59.770
Hurry and get in.

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:01.910
I'm not getting in.

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:06.280
What do you mean you're not getting in?

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:10.310
Resign.

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.180
And give me the car keys.

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:17.050
Where is this coming from?

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.560
Did Director Ko say I should resign?

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:22.530
Just give me the keys first.

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:26.000
- Yeong Ra. - Give me the keys.

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:27.530
It's my car.

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:33.600
Yes, it's your car,

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.910
and I'll give you the keys since you're asking,

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.380
but don't you think you owe me an explanation first?

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:41.280
Is this about that day?

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:43.710
Because I made a mistake?

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.120
So it was a mistake?

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.120
Of course, it was.

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.960
Because I'm your bodyguard.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:01.900
Right. That's a relief.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.400
Then you can go ahead and resign for making that mistake.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.110
Something's happened to you, right?

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:10.470
What is it?

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.080
If my car isn't parked in front of our house,

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.980
you'll be in danger.

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:17.350
You could even be killed.

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.590
That motorcycle accident.

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:24.150
It was a warning from my mother.

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:27.620
What did you say?

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:30.630
So just write your resignation and submit it to my dad.

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.160
If you want to live.

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.270
So that motorcycle...

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.070
Your mother was behind that?

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:45.540
Goodbye, Ji Wan.

00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:49.610
Yeong Ra.

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:52.280
Then...

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.720
What about you?

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.090
I'll clean up my own mess.

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:00.960
Don't worry about me.

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:04.960
If you ever...

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.030
need me,

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.240
call me.

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.140
Let's not...

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.040
see each other again.

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:35.430
Hello.

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.760
Mother.

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:41.430
I'm right on time, aren't I?

00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.400
Mother, what are you doing here? You didn't even call.

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:48.770
Does a kidnapper call ahead before they snatch you?

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:50.940
Kidnapper?

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:53.510
I guess this is what's in fashion these days.

00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:00.950
(Price: 2,539 dollars)

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:05.490

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.130
What's with you?

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:11.430
Mother, I don't want to get anything from here.

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:14.360
I've been saving up my emergency fund.

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:16.930
I was going to buy you a nice outfit.

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:19.440
Su Bin also paid me for appearing in her videos.

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:21.200
Let's go to the outlets, Mother.

00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:22.810
Just be quiet...

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:24.540
and answer your phone.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:27.240
How can I answer the phone if I have to be quiet?

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:29.750
(Daughter)

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.210
It's Su Bin.

00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.850
Remember, don't tell her we're at the mall.

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:40.790
- Su Bin. - Mom, why aren't you home yet?

00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:43.160
Something urgent came up.

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:47.130
There's braised fish in the fridge, and Grandma made radish soup too.

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.400
- Just heat that up and eat. - Okay.

00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:50.470
Okay.

00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:55.410
Mother, why is it a secret that we're here?

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:58.780
Su Bin promised to pay me again next month.

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:04.110
- I'll surprise everyone one by one. - Mother.

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:06.080
You're already planning to spend it all?

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:07.380
Let's go!

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:11.420
- This one. - Okay.

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.220
- This one. - Okay.

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:18.300
- This too. - Sure.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:26.800
It's a nice cut, but that's not your colour.

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:28.210
Try on the next one.

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:34.540
So elegant. You look like a lily. Perfect.

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:41.350
Oh, my goodness. Stunning!

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.090
Give me a twirl.

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:44.890
Turn.

00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:48.460
Oh, my goodness. Stunning. It's perfect!

00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:58.300
If only money weren't an issue.

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.870
That second one was practically made for you, too.

00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:06.910
Even this one is too expensive. I want to return it.

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.910
"Return" isn't in my vocabulary. Not today, anyway.

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.720
You can't use your life savings on an outfit for me.

00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:16.650
And how would you know what my life savings are?

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.660
Let's go get something to eat. Come on.

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:29.500
You look like you're about to cry.

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:31.770
For the price of this one outfit,

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.470
I could buy a whole year's worth of clothes at the outlet.

00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:38.110
And we could have gotten something for your son, too.

00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.480
He's a man,

00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.210
and you're a lady.

00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:44.280
And a working woman, at that.

00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:46.780
Seeing you all dressed up...

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:50.550
Honestly, you looked stunning.

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:54.360
Mother, seriously...

00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:56.260
It's been...

00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.060
well over 30 years since you became my daughter-in-law.

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:03.370
And in all that time,

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.140
I can count on one hand the times I gave you cash for your birthday.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.470
But you never...

01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:13.410
missed my birthday. Not even once.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.950
You always got me shoes, clothes, or whatever I needed.

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:19.120
You always made sure I was taken care of.

01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:24.750
I could never afford to get you anything nice.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.390
Don't be silly.

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:30.930
They were all wonderful.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.760
They were all beautiful. I mean it.

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:53.080
- Mother. - Yes?

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.150
The subway is this way.

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:57.850
- We'll take a cab today. Let's go. - Wait, Mother!

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.060
Come on, hurry up.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.190
Mother!

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:05.160
The subway is just one transfer. It'll be quick.

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.300
Listen, dear.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.970
It feels pretty good to spend money, you know?

01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:13.340
Let's treat ourselves, just for today.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.940
We got our first designer outfit from a department store,

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:19.080
so we can't possibly take the subway now, can we?

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.110
You have a point there, Mother.

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:26.180
And my feet ache from walking, so it's nice to be comfortable.

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.320
Exactly.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.820
I don't need anything more.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.190
I just wish every day could be like today.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.970
- No. - No!

Good timing. I'm making pasta.

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.500
- Do you want some? - No, I'm good.

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:19.170

- Just hurry. Please, hurry. - Yes, okay. I'm on my way.

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.730
I'm sorry. There was a mistake scheduling your interview.
