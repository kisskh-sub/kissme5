I'm here to protect Your Highness.

There is no rebellion here.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.680
Your Highness, are you going to continue to play dumb?

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.070
Twenty years ago, on your wedding night,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.190
Su Rang helped you quell the rebellion in the palace.

You're Jibei King.

Shouldn't you find out the truth?

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.240
Dou, what are you talking about?

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.000

First,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.040
why did your family

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.960

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.830
Second,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.040
The inner attendant, Su Rang

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.040

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.680
including my father.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.960
He wronged loyal officials for no reason.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.680
What is his crime?

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.680
Third,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.270
the palace caught fire.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.720

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.550
were burned.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.190

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.030
So, they call it "Hole Ghost".

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.720
Is there

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.670
such a strange thing?

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.670
I don't believe it.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.000
I believe it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.150
I heard that man is made of clay.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.270
Maybe we are also made of clay.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.830
My parents used to intimidate me with the Hole Ghost.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.440
They said the Hole Ghost snatched kids who didn't sleep.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.040
I don't dare to go to the toilet

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.230
by myself at night now.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.200
The Hole Ghost only snatches babies under the age of one year.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.030
Dove, you're not a baby. Don't worry.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.750
You're also scared.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.750
You asked me to go to the toilet with you last night.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.390
Shut up.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.600
I'm not scared.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.610
I'm not scared.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.480
Look at the situation.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.720
Could you cut it out?

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.270
Fu Sheng, what did you say?

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.910
Gu Tian said it.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.480
She's asking you

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.200
what you said.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.320
What did I say?

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.270
Fu Sheng.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.420
You became naughty.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.390
Fu Sheng, you really became naughty.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.550
No.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.910
I have a question.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.640
Does the Hole Ghost

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.870
move at a regular time?

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.270
Do you know it?

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.780
Since you don't know,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.600
we don't have

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.510
to stay here.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.320
Let's go.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.670
Let's visit the families who lost their babies.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.750
We should have left a long time ago.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.600
- Keep up. - My legs are numb.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.200
Give me a hand...

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.030
You'll be fine in a minute.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.870
You'll be fine in a minute.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.600
Fu Sheng.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.360
Ever since our baby lost,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.960
he's been quiet.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.030
All he does is strike the iron.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.360
I'm no different from a widow.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.390
Madam.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.270
Do you remember

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.840
when your baby was lost?

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.960
It was three years ago today.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.120
Today?

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.200
It was the 15th on the lunar calendar.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.510
Yes.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.910
It was the 15th.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.750
I asked other families

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.240
who have lost their babies.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.630
Their babies

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.390
were also lost on the 15th night.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.720
That night,

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.320
the moon was big and round.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.390
My husband was striking iron in the yard.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.440
I was sewing shoes

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.550
with my baby in my arms

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.670
at the door under the moonlight.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.670
Madam.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.480
Was there a clay doll left

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.000
when the baby was taken away?

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.200
Yes.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.790
My husband

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.720
wanted to smash that doll.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.150
I didn't let him.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.240
And I hid it.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.270
I'll get it for you.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.200
Okay, thank you.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.480
Here you go.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.550
Madam.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.440
Can we borrow it for a few days?

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:15.630
Well...

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.720
It's not like it's a treasure.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.720
Don't take it as our baby.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.150
Can it call you Mom?

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.240
Take it away

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.390
as you wish.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.000
Don't send it back.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.030
No.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.870
It's the only thing our baby left.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.510
It's from the ghost,

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.720
not our baby.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.440
Fu Sheng.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.750
Is there a ghost on the night of a full moon?

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:57.390
No.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.720
A short month has 30 days.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.270
A long month has 31 days.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.360
Why do they steal babies on the night of a full moon?

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.600
It's not advisable to go out

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.790
on the night of a full moon.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.240
Yes.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.790
People consider it taboo.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.760
On that day,

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.520
people all stay at home.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:17.700
I see.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.960
The Hole Ghost

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.320
wants to use the legend

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.300
to frighten the people.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.200
So when he goes to snatch babies,

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.110
they are at home.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.280
You're right.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.110
But there's more than that.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.040
When it happens,

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.470
people will link it

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.040
to ghosts.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.350
They believe

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.350
that the ghost stole their babies.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.350
In that case,

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.750
the real culprit

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.560
would get away with it.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.400
If you are targeted by the ghost,

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.800
it will go to you

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.590
even if you don't go out.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.160
Don't worry.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.630
The Hole Ghost will give himself away.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.800
Fu Sheng.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.590
Did you borrow the clay doll to eat it?

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.350
Wen Jue.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.400
We need to get Jiu here.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.990
We need a lot of people.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.680
What are we going to do?

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.400
Are you sure you can catch the Hole Ghost?

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.630
The Hole Ghost snatched babies

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.080
on the nights of a full moon.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.320
His targets

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.920
were always babies less than a year old.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.830
Only 22 families in Xichuan

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.750
meet this condition.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.830
As long as

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:36.920
we keep an eye on them,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:37.990
I'm sure

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.400
we'll catch him.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.440
Okay. I believe you this time.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.110
If you can catch the Hole Ghost,

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.750
all the people of Xichuan will thank you.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.280
You should thank Wen Jue.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.830
She did a lot for it.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:51.470
Jiu.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.630
Why don't you go where you're supposed to be?

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.440
What are you doing here?

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:55.920
Go.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:58.400
Did I bother you?

00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.110
I'm going.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:00.400
How did you arrange it?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.630
Why am I alone over there?

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:04.830
What's wrong?

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.110
If you're not there,

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.800
how can I fight the ghost?

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.950
Honey, it's tied up.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.560
Come on.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.750
Come on.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.110
It's the Hole Ghost.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.440
[Liu Da]

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.830
It's not necessarily us.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.770
Our baby is gone.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.760
Sir, something went wrong.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.040
Sir, it's all my fault.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.040
That baby

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.150
is gone.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.910
Good for nothing.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.480
How did the baby get lost?

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.320
Are you sure

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.390
no one entered the house?

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.560
We didn't see anyone.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.150
My wife and I

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.420
were guarding the door and window.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.670
We're sure no one entered.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.770
What do you mean?

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.150
Was it a ghost?

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.560
I heard a cry.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.080
Then, I saw

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.150
a black hole

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.630
that was going to suck me in.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And there were some ghosts

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.000
wandering around the hole.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.320
I chop it with an axe.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.560
But I couldn't chop it.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.910
Later, the ghost disappeared.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.480
Our baby also disappeared.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.870
All that's left is this.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.110
It's different from the previous one.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.040
It smells new.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:39.280
I can smell clay.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.720
I asked all the neighbors.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.040
None of them heard the Hole Ghost.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.150
Some of Liu Da's neighbors

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.390
heard a baby crying.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.870
They knew that Liu Da had a baby.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.630
So they didn't take it seriously.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.390
The people who lived a little farther away

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.080
said they didn't hear anything.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.190
They didn't hear anything?

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.280
It screamed loudly.

How could they have heard nothing?

They are too timid

to help me.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.150
I have an idea.

Take the medicine I gave you on time.

Go get your medicine.

It's past noon.

We didn't even have time to eat.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.280
I misestimated the number of people.

I can't see all of them.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:47.560
I'll tell them

to come back another day.

No.

Go to the clinic.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.150
Bring over the tent and the oil lamp.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.280

Our clinic is in that direction. Where are you going?

These herbs are not enough.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.910
I'll go to the medicine shop on the east side to get some.

Put it on my tab.

Have you been in good health lately?

It's an old problem.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.320
My joints ache every rainy day.

What baby?

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.190
Baby!

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.040
My baby!

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.000

Why are you avoiding me?

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.390
If you didn't snatch the baby,

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.520
I wouldn't have hit you.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.720
I didn't know you were the father.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.870
You were screaming loudly.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.280
I thought it was the Hole Ghost.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.870
You hit him with a jar.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.830
Your baby...

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:37.910
It's not a baby.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.720
It's a jinx.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.240
We've lost a baby.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.870
Do you still want to lose another one?

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.040
Don't talk nonsense.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.670
The baby's face is pale,

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.080
and his lips are purple.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.390
His heart is underdeveloped.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.560
Let me check him out, okay?

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.630
No need.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.480
We were poisoned by the water in the Holy Pool.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.280
That's why he's born weaker than ordinary babies

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.520
and prone to premature death.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.020
The poison on the statue

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.000
can affect the fetus.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.920
We didn't know

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.800
that he was born weak

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.960
because we were poisoned.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.500
We made him suffer.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.360
Thankfully, Physician Fu

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.900
told us the truth.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.100
Looks like the poisonous water not only causes sores on the face

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.560
but also affects the fetus in the womb.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.350
The babies

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.760

were sickly.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.140
In that case,

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.800
the Hole Ghost only stole babies affected by the poisonous water.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.730
That's what they say in the slums.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.800
What about the Chang's Mansion?

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.440
They're in the inner city.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.400
They wouldn't have come here to worship God.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.000
Were they also poisoned by the statue?

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.090
There is a problem.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.110
Let's go to the Chang's Mansion again.

This is my kid.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.190
He's the only kid

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:04.800

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.390

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.190
what happened back then?

Nice wine.

to find such a good wine

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.150
during curfew.

When my father left, he asked me

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.110
to treat you as a father.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.390

to bring you some smoked meat and a roast goose

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.950
to thank you.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.270
It's my duty.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.920
Please thank our lord for me.

It can't go far. I'll chase him.

Go. Hurry.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.390
- Go. - Mr. Song.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.040

What happened next?

Did Song Yuan catch up with him?

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:45.200
I don't know.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.590
All I know is

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.240
that I saw Han Shuo

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.390
running wild on the way.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.590
He looked like he had seen a ghost.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.630
He was crazy

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.110
and couldn't hear.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.670
Then, he ran into the caravan

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:00.950
and was shot by an arrow.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.350
When I saw Song Yuan,

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.360
he only had one last breath left.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.840
He was holding my baby in his arms.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.000
He murmured,

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.040
"The west of the city."

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:19.710
"In the woods."

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.080
I think the ghost is fake.

They're trying to snatch other people's children.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.360
Well.

Have you ever worshipped the statue

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.870

My wife had miscarriages all the time.

After she was pregnant,

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.150
we invited a fortune teller here.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:45.120
He said our baby was haunted,

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.630
and we had to wash my wife's body with the water of the Holy Pool

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.190
to ask the gods

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:51.760
to save this baby.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:52.950
I see.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.120
After your baby was snatched,

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.390
was there a clay doll?

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:01.600
Yes.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.430
Do you still have it?

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.280
Do you remember

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.950
what the clay doll looks like?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:12.780
Its head

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:14.070
is hollow.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.440
According to Mr. Chang and Luo Ye,

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.870
I think the jade

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.550
is in the Hole Ghost's hands.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.150
I didn't expect that we had only been separated for a short time

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.150
and you had found such an important clue.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.350
That's not all.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.760
We also found

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.520
that the Changs had touched the poisonous water of the Holy Pool.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.590
That's why their baby is sickly.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.040
Is it a clue?

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.460
It is.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.220
We can be sure

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.050
that the lost children are all congenitally sick.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.050
The person who did it

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.960
would leave a freshly made clay doll

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.070
at the crime scene every time.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.800
It shows

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.960
it was premeditated.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.280
Do ghosts scout a place before snatching a baby?

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.830
There are no ghosts in the world.

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.920
It was done by people.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.110
They didn't even let go of the poor children.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.280
I'll catch them

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.760
and punish them severely.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.280
How did they steal the babies?

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.200
I guess

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.960
they dropped hallucinogenic drugs

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.960
on their targets

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.740
at night

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.390
to make them hallucinate.

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.590
Then, they made a special sound

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.590
to make people think it was a ghost.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.680
They confused the people.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.040
Hallucinogenic drugs?

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.110
Is it the same as the painting in the Lin's Mansion?

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.590
It's stronger than that painting.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.830
It seems

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:42.630
that there is someone behind this.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.430
The weather is getting cold.

It's hot.

The day after the full moon,

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.320
the Hole Ghost would appear in the West Woods.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:03.600
You can go there and check it out.

My lord,

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.630
we think

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.000
General Du Shang

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.520
is loyal to Jibei King.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.600
You can give him the military power.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.400
Okay.

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:24.540
You may leave.

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.880
There's something I haven't told you.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:33.630
Rebel Zhu

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.400
is dead.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.560
Really?

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:41.790
I sent someone to check it out.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.600
It's true.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.190
Congratulations, My Lord.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.670
More than twenty years have passed.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.310
The rebel is finally dead.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:52.310
We don't have to worry about that anymore.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.190
Back then,

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.230
Sage Zhu of the Breakwall

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.310
rebelled against His Highness

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.520
on his wedding day.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:04.960
He stole

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.830
the Bird Jade Plate, the key to the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.880
It's been so many years.

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.350
But the Bird Jade Plate hasn't shown up.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.270
Now,

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:17.080
the rebel is dead.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:18.960
But the Bird Jade Plate's whereabouts

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:21.120
are unknown.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.310
That's what worries me the most.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.400
How can I not be worried?

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.790
I'd like to find it for you.

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:32.830
I'd like to find it for you.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.960
I know you're loyal.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.270
I've sent General Guo Sishui to Xichuan.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:43.400
She'll

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.880
send back a message soon.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.520
We're waiting for your good news.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:20.130
Wait.
