Can you hear the drums, Fernando?

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:31.823
I remember long ago
Another starry night like this

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.326
In the fire...

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:39.748
Dadgum it!

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.337
No!

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:51.008
Help! Help!

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.471
Mom! Dad!

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.231
Mom!

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.568
Mom! Mom!

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.653
- Holly?
- Mom! Mom!

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.448
- Mom, the monster!
- Baby, what are you doing? What's wrong?

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:18.744
- Mom, there's a monster in there.
- Holly, slow down. I can't understand you!

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.872
- Mom, there's a monster. The mon--
- Holly.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.041
Whatever you saw, baby,
it was just a nightmare.

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.794
- No, Mom! Mom!
- Baby, it's just a nightmare!

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.089
I saw it. Please trust me, Mom.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:33.676
Please, Mom, please.
You gotta believe me. Please.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.611
What the heck?

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.626
What's your location? Over.

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:08.752
Pickett, five minutes away.

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:11.004
You're way ahead of us.
Radio as soon as you're there!

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:12.005
I will.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.924
And Nancy, be careful.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:14.926
Hold on.

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:25.186
There was something
In the air that night

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.858
The stars were bright, Fernando

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:34.153
They were shining there for you and me

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:38.448
For liberty, Fernando

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:42.411
Though we never thought
That we could lose

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:43.997
There's no regret

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.585
If I had to do the same again

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:57.302
There was something
In the air that night

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.055
The stars were bright, Fernando

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.024
Karen!

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.200
Heavens to Betsy.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.118
Karen!

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.206
Everything all right?

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.460
Holly?

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:39.802
Holly!

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.555
Holy smokes.

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.519
Oh God. Hey. Stay back. Stay back!

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.647
Back!

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:13.878
Go! Go!

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:19.008
Mom!

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.596
Oh, God!

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:25.932
Holly, get back!

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:40.530
Stay away from my daughter!

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:42.949
Mom, no!

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.296
It's inside.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.257
I see it. Get ready.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.233
Nancy, what's going on?
Talk to me! What's happening?

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.444
Nancy!

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:28.494
Stay away from my daughter!

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.158
Mom!

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:14.998
Don't try to talk, okay?
Just stay calm, okay?

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.543
You're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine, okay?

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:19.086
You're gonna be fine.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:20.088
Holly.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:42.527
Go. Go, go, go, go! Go!

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:49.491
You're gonna be okay, Mom.
I'm right here. Just stay with me. Okay?

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.952
Can you do that?
Can you please stay with me?

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.787
I promise
I won't let anything happen to you.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:56.832
I'm gonna get you help.
I just need you to hold on, okay?

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.126
Just hold on.

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:09.988
Vitals. Talk to me.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.698
Female, 46 years old.

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:14.784
- Heart rate 120. BP 103/67.
- Got a male, late forties.

00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:16.495
Multiple blunt impact. Weak abdominal...

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.330
Pulse is thready and weak.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.541
Lacerations to the right anterior chest
and penetrating neck trauma.

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:23.044
We're right here. You're okay.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.420
I'm sorry. You have to wait outside.

00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:28.548
- Can't we stay with them?
- We have to let the doctors do their job.

00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:31.718
We'll update you
as soon as we know something, okay? Okay?

00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:33.179
I can't see a damn thing.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.430
Cross-match, get to the bag.

00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:36.765
Where’s my X-ray cart?

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.227
- Maybe four broken ribs.
- Stand by to intubate.

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.079
This is our fault.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.874
This is all our fault.

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:48.629
We got there as fast as we could.

00:09:49.338 --> 00:09:51.631
I'm not talking about tonight.

00:09:51.632 --> 00:09:57.429
We could have acted yesterday,
last week, last fall.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.598
We could've tried
to get them out of Hawkins,

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.517
or... or at least told them the truth.

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:05.729
We could have done something, anything.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.690
We couldn't have known
any of this would happen.

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:10.109
Do you really believe that?

00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:13.528
After all this time, it comes for Holly?

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:15.905
Holly, who has nothing to do
with any of this.

00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:17.699
It makes no goddamn sense.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.619
It makes perfect goddamn sense.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.370
Vecna told me this would happen.

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:23.913
He showed me.

00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:25.415
And not just the four gates.

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:27.168
Holly, Mom, Dad dead.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.880
And we just...
we just chose not to believe him.

00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:34.967
But now it's all coming true.
Like, don't you get it, Mike?

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:39.763
Vecna's come back
to realize his vision, to punish us.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.015
He did it with Fred and Chrissy and Max,

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:43.266
and now it's our turn.

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:44.726
And he's not gonna stop.

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:48.648
He's not gonna stop until we're drained
of every last ounce of suffering.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:52.234
I'm not so sure this was about punishment.

00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:55.362
Vecna doesn't leave things unfinished.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.197
He doesn't hold back.

00:10:57.198 --> 00:11:01.451
Because if this was really about
making you guys suffer,

00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:03.203
why leave your parents alive?

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.288
Why take Holly into the Upside Down

00:11:05.289 --> 00:11:07.123
and not leave her body here
for you to find?

00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:08.833
Why not come here himself?

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:10.835
Why send one of his... his pets?

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.838
What are you saying? It's not Vecna?

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.174
What I'm saying is I don't know,

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:17.509
and neither do you.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.636
There are just too many questions
right now.

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:23.264
I... I just know I'm having serious déjà vu,

00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:25.684
because this is
exactly what happened to Will

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.895
at almost exactly the same time.

00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:34.694
You know what date it is, right?

00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:36.903
November 3rd.

00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:38.823
Will was taken on the 6th.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.367
We are less than three days away.

00:11:42.743 --> 00:11:45.955
Three days away
from the day that changed everything.

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.834
I don't know about you guys, but...

00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:54.255
...I don't believe in coincidences.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:57.758
Not anymore.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.136
But we got Will back.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.513
And we're going to get Holly back,
'cause she's not alone.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:05.265
Eleven's in there with her.

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:07.267
And if anybody can save your sister--

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.602
It's El.

00:12:09.937 --> 00:12:10.855
It's El.

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:18.528
Stay indoors!

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:20.614
Stay inside!

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.214
The daughter found her mother here.

00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:41.886
We believe Mrs. Wheeler was trying
to escape when she was attacked.

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:45.013
And no one saw this intruder?

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:47.974
No. By the time she got home,
the intruder was gone,

00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:49.310
along with her sister.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.565
The daughter, she arrive alone?

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:57.276
That's what she told us, sir.

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:17.253
I want you to pull up
all video surveillance

00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:19.673
within a two-mile radius of this house.

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:22.468
- You think it could be her, sir?
- Now.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:41.821
Holly! Holly!

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:44.406
Holly!

00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:35.082
Hop.

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:37.251
Hop!

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.168
Hop?

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:41.588
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:42.840
El.

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:45.384
How are you here?

00:14:53.183 --> 00:14:54.768
Wait. Wait.

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:57.937
Wait. You gotta...

00:14:57.938 --> 00:15:01.357
You gotta get out of here. It's not safe.

00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:03.234
- There's--
- A Demogorgon.

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:04.904
I know. It's bleeding.

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:07.697
She must have hurt it.

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:08.866
What? Who?

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:11.410
Karen. With her wine.

00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:13.120
What?

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:17.665
When I search for Holly,
I can't find her, but she must be close.

00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:19.918
- Holly?
- We just need to find the blood.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.212
Holly Wheeler? What are you...

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:25.591
El, wait! Goddamn it!

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:33.057
Whoa.

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:36.435
It's like everything went kablooey
all at once.

00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:44.734
Has this kind of thing happened
with his visions before?

00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:47.820
Where the lights go kooky
and electronics short-circuit?

00:15:47.821 --> 00:15:49.322
No.

00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:51.909
So this is just, like,
a fun, new development.

00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:54.786
Aren't there any backup fuses
or something?

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:58.248
Yeah, in storage, I think so.
I mean, I hope so, right?

00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:03.169
Oh! Uh... You'd like me to go get them?

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.462
- Yeah.
- Right.

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:07.674
Uh, of course. I am totally on it.

00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:09.426
I... I'll be right back.

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:17.892
I know it's hard to talk about,

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:21.647
but these... these visions,

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.815
were they like before?

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:26.652
Like when you had your now memories?

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:34.701
Only more intense.

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:38.956
It's like I was there. I was right there.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:45.254
It's... It's like I was the Demogorgon.

00:16:47.297 --> 00:16:53.762
I was seeing what it was seeing
and thinking what it was thinking.

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:58.099
Do you have any idea
why it would go after the Wheelers,

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.392
take Holly?

00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:01.770
I don't... I'm not sure. It's...

00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:08.651
It's so hard to remember everything.
It's... It's almost like a dream.

00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:11.362
This doesn't make any sense. I...

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:17.035
I... I must have somehow
tapped back into the hive mind.

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:18.746
But we severed the connection.

00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:25.419
I don't think it was ever... truly severed.

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:31.216
Ever since he took me, it's like I... I was...

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.720
permanently changed.

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:42.435
These feelings of connection,
they come and go.

00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:45.898
But that summer, after the gate opened,

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.526
I felt him again.

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:54.740
And it went away when I was in California.

00:17:55.824 --> 00:17:57.701
But the day after I got back,

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:00.621
the feeling returned.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.374
And now he's closer.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.461
He's closer than ever before.

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:10.338
Maybe you're like a receiver.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:14.551
You know, like a radio receiver,
just a magical human version.

00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:17.930
- I... I don't follow.
- Okay.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.684
Imagine that you have an antenna
coming up from the top of your head.

00:18:23.685 --> 00:18:27.897
And Vecna, he uses
Mind Flayer particles like radio waves.

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:31.901
When the antenna is close to the waves,
the signal comes through clear as day.

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:33.611
But if you're too far away...

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:34.613
Static.

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.491
So maybe that's how we do it.

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:39.868
That's how we find Holly.

00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:43.830
What, with your antenna?

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:47.334
Earlier, I had a vision
in the woods near the school.

00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:50.753
I didn't understand it at the time,

00:18:50.754 --> 00:18:53.923
but maybe I was seeing
through the Demogorgon's eyes then too.

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:55.341
And maybe if I go back there,

00:18:55.342 --> 00:18:57.760
I can connect back to the hive mind,
to the signal.

00:18:57.761 --> 00:18:58.678
Will.

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:01.848
- I've spied on Vecna before.
- And he took control of you.

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:03.808
- I know, but--
- You almost died.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.852
And Holly will too
if we don't do something.

00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:07.311
We are doing something.

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:08.563
Replacing fuses?

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:11.649
We've got to get the Squawk back up
so we can find Hopper.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.985
Hopper, right.
This is about your boyfriend.

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:17.613
He's our only connection
to the Upside Down, to El.

00:19:17.614 --> 00:19:19.699
How does that get us closer to Holly?

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.827
She's in there, Mom, all alone.
I know what that's like.

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.662
I won't just leave her there.

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:25.830
We're gonna get her back,

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.458
but we're not gonna risk your life
while doing it.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.923
- Are you just gonna stand there?
- Right.

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:39.177
Uh, intimate family moment. Sorry.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.180
Fuses, power. On it.

00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:57.445
How long is this gonna take?

00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:58.696
Not too long.

00:19:58.697 --> 00:20:01.658
We just gotta let this sucker charge
for a few minutes, then hopefully...

00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:03.452
vroom, vroom.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.629
Bopper, while we wait?

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.758
Well, this better be quick.

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:21.886
Our good Samaritan's turning sour.
I think she might have placed me.

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:25.223
- Placed you?
- Stood up her sister. Multiple occasions.

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:26.183
Great.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.518
Did you get a hold of Nance?

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.732
Dad's in an induced coma,
and Mom's in surgery.

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:37.110
They're not gonna know anything
for a couple hours.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.988
Jesus Christ, man.

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:42.866
Yeah.

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:46.870
You think we should go see her
at the hospital?

00:20:47.704 --> 00:20:50.206
I mean, if we can get
this hunk of junk moving.

00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:51.290
Mmm...

00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:54.086
No. No, we stick to the plan.

00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:55.920
Search Zone G1.

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:59.716
- Find Hopper, find Eleven and find Holly.
- Right.

00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:03.762
Just... That seems complicated.

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:07.599
Like, it might take a lot of time.

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:09.100
Okay.

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.060
You know, the hospital is on the way.

00:21:11.061 --> 00:21:13.604
We could just swing by,

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.606
bring Nance, like, flowers or something.

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:16.857
Jesus Christ.

00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:18.067
What?

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.695
I just thought that,
tonight of all nights,

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:22.488
you might just give it a rest.

00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:23.781
Give what a rest?

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:26.701
This bullshit macho competition
for Nancy's attention.

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:29.245
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.998
- Yeah.
- Really?

00:21:31.498 --> 00:21:35.334
Dude, ever since I got back from Lenora,
you are constantly showing off for her.

00:21:35.335 --> 00:21:37.086
How you're better than me!

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:38.963
Which is shitty enough on a normal day,

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:42.300
but now her parents are fighting
for their lives, her sister is missing,

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:44.552
and all you can think about
is giving her flowers.

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:47.014
You selfish, chauvinistic meathead!

00:21:57.274 --> 00:21:58.357
You know what, Byers?

00:21:58.358 --> 00:22:00.276
You're totally right.

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:03.529
Me worrying about
my good friend, my friend,

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.614
that makes me the selfish one here.

00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:09.827
Or maybe, just maybe,
you're the problem, dude.

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:11.203
Ever since you got back,

00:22:11.204 --> 00:22:13.456
you've been acting
like a paranoid pothead weirdo.

00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:17.543
And maybe if you stopped focusing on me
and started focusing on her,

00:22:17.544 --> 00:22:19.962
maybe then the two of you
would finally be happy.

00:22:19.963 --> 00:22:21.464
Because right now, the only one

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:23.925
who's more miserable
in that relationship than you...

00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:25.761
is Nance.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.657
You've got to be shitting me.

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:58.459
And you got there how, exactly?

00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.543
Get where?

00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:02.380
The Wheeler house.
Did you take the Henderson shelter?

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:04.174
No. Nancy drove me.

00:23:07.302 --> 00:23:09.513
Nancy drove you?

00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:11.764
Yes.

00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:14.101
We don't drive ever, do we?

00:23:14.851 --> 00:23:16.602
- Do we?
- No.

00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:18.270
No, we take the tunnels,

00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:21.065
and we don't surface until it's clear,
until it's safe.

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.149
I wore my hoodie.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.068
Oh, well, geez, that's great.

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:27.154
I don't know why we've been
crawling around in the mud all this time.

00:23:27.155 --> 00:23:29.323
We should've just drove you around
in your hoodie.

00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:30.699
The tunnels are too slow.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.201
Holly was in danger.

00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:33.619
Yeah, and now so are you.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.747
If those military guys haven't already
caught you on camera, they will.

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:37.665
And when they do,

00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:40.751
they'll be coming for you
with everything they got.

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:43.087
Then we have to end this
before they find us.

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:45.047
Is that what this is about, ending this?

00:23:45.048 --> 00:23:47.508
The Demogorgon can lead us to Vecna.

00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:48.467
How?

00:23:48.468 --> 00:23:52.222
When I searched for Holly,
I could not find her, just like Vecna.

00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:57.476
So maybe wherever she is, he is,
where my powers cannot reach.

00:23:57.477 --> 00:24:01.397
I'm sorry.
So your... your theory is what, exactly?

00:24:01.398 --> 00:24:05.109
It's that the Demogorgon has taken
little Holly Wheeler to Vecna

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.528
as some kind of early Christmas present?

00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:12.450
What does Vecna want with Holly Wheeler?
What... How does any of this make sense?

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.618
- I don't know!
- Exactly, you don't know.

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:18.164
Because you haven't put any thought
into anything you've been doing tonight.

00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:23.294
You've been acting on impulse, on emotion,
everything I taught you not to do!

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.046
Goddamn it...

00:24:26.089 --> 00:24:27.591
More blood than before.

00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:29.968
It's slowing down.

00:24:31.219 --> 00:24:32.554
We can still catch it.

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.474
And not emotion.

00:24:37.017 --> 00:24:38.185
Instinct.

00:24:47.527 --> 00:24:51.155
We don't know where Hop or El are,

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:55.285
or if they found each other or Holly,
or... or anything.

00:24:56.203 --> 00:24:58.038
We're totally in the dark up here.

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:04.044
You don't wanna hurt me

00:25:05.378 --> 00:25:07.923
I wish I... I had better news.

00:25:11.384 --> 00:25:13.637
Hopefully my next update will be

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:18.265
something like El and Hop saved Holly,
and killed Vecna,

00:25:18.266 --> 00:25:21.603
and everyone's back home
celebrating and everything.

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:27.150
But if I've learned anything
over the years...

00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:31.404
it's never gonna be that easy.

00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:37.244
El's amazing.

00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:43.332
But she can't do this alone.
She's gonna need all the help she can get.

00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:46.545
She's going to need the party,
the full party.

00:25:47.462 --> 00:25:48.588
Which is why I'm here.

00:25:51.466 --> 00:25:52.592
The final battle...

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:55.804
I feel like it started tonight.

00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:01.893
And Max, we can't win this without you.

00:26:02.602 --> 00:26:04.603
If my theory is right,
we're running out of time.

00:26:04.604 --> 00:26:08.858
So if you're planning on resurrecting
anytime soon, now... now is the time.

00:26:12.445 --> 00:26:15.574
Even a sign would be enough
to show me you're still in there.

00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:21.162
Please, Max.

00:26:23.206 --> 00:26:24.249
Please.

00:26:26.668 --> 00:26:27.752
Wake up.

00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:31.214
Just... something.

00:26:33.883 --> 00:26:35.051
I miss you.

00:26:36.469 --> 00:26:40.723
Oh, come on, angel
Come on, come on, darlin'

00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:44.853
Let's exchange the experience

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:26.852
Okay, so, you're not gonna believe this,

00:27:26.853 --> 00:27:29.688
but she still won't give us a timeline
on seeing Mom.

00:27:29.689 --> 00:27:31.732
And... And I wasn't even asking to see Mom.

00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:34.903
I was just asking to talk to the doctor,
and she just kept saying...

00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:38.239
Mike. Mike, are you listening?

00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:41.076
Yeah. Yeah, no. Uh...

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:44.244
I was thinking about
something Lucas said earlier,

00:27:44.245 --> 00:27:48.124
about how he doesn't believe
in coincidences anymore, and...

00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:51.002
Did Holly ever talk to you
about Mr. Whatsit?

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:55.714
Her... imaginary friend from the book?

00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:59.718
Well, yeah, it's Mrs. Whatsit in the book.
So... So, this is her own creation.

00:27:59.719 --> 00:28:01.011
At least that's what I thought.

00:28:01.012 --> 00:28:03.055
When I went to pick her up
from school today,

00:28:03.056 --> 00:28:07.017
she said that Mr. Whatsit told her
that there were monsters in Hawkins.

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:10.771
And he warned her that these monsters,
they were coming for her.

00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:14.066
And on the same day,
she's actually taken by a monster?

00:28:14.067 --> 00:28:17.403
I mean, as far as coincidences go,
that's a hell of a one.

00:28:17.404 --> 00:28:20.489
And your theory is... what exactly?

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:23.535
What if Mr. Whatsit isn't a figment
of Holly's imagination?

00:28:25.578 --> 00:28:27.497
- What if he's real?
- Real?

00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:29.748
Yeah, what if?

00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:34.628
It... It doesn't make sense.
How have we never seen him?

00:28:34.629 --> 00:28:36.422
Maybe we have, and we just didn't know.

00:28:36.423 --> 00:28:38.590
- So who the hell is he?
- I don't know.

00:28:38.591 --> 00:28:41.385
- How does he know that Holly's in danger?
- I don't know.

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:44.138
If he was so worried,
then why wouldn't he warn us or Mom

00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:45.431
or do something about it?

00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:46.932
I don't know, Nance.

00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:49.018
My theory, it has holes.

00:28:51.771 --> 00:28:55.274
You were right
about what you said earlier.

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:59.237
We could have done more
to protect Mom and Dad and Holly, and...

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:02.990
I don't want to have any more regrets.

00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:05.159
And maybe my theory is wrong.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:10.039
But if it isn't, if Mr. Whatsit is real,
then he would know things.

00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:13.459
Like why Holly was taken,
or... or maybe even--

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.295
Where she was taken.

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:21.759
And how do you propose
we go about finding out who this guy is?

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.969
I was kind of hoping you'd tell me.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.973
You're the genius investigative reporter
after all.

00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:29.934
That's not fair. Appealing to my ego.

00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:42.404
Okay. I'm gonna need you
to talk to that receptionist

00:29:42.405 --> 00:29:45.867
and do your best sad,
lost boy, puppy dog thing.

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:47.534
My what? Why?

00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:50.746
Because she hates me, and you're cute,
and we're gonna need her help

00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:54.042
if we want to get close to the one person
who knows about Mr. Whatsit,

00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:55.668
Mom.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.465
And by sheer luck,
Jessica was coming back from a party,

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:03.550
and I charmed my way
into getting us a jump.

00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:07.888
Which brings us to you,
arriving looking like Rocky Balboa.

00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:13.352
So basically, of all the crawls,
this was, like, the one to miss.

00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:17.607
So, well done, Henderson.
Really, really, like, well done.

00:30:22.403 --> 00:30:24.112
Speechless. That's new.

00:30:24.113 --> 00:30:26.574
I'm still processing, Steve. It's a lot.

00:30:27.784 --> 00:30:28.952
Holly?

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:30.661
Why Holly?

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:33.831
Well, maybe Eleven could tell us,
but it's a bit difficult to contact her

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:36.166
now that we've lost our connection
to the Upside Down.

00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:39.920
Okay. For the future, when the lights go
from really bright to really dim,

00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:42.840
it means the generator is surging
so you have to turn everything off.

00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:44.299
- Wow. Great.
- Immediately.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.427
Thank you. I'll remember that
the next time that happens.

00:30:47.428 --> 00:30:51.890
Or, maybe, and this is just a suggestion,
you could be where you're supposed to be.

00:30:51.891 --> 00:30:53.725
I was en route to the Squawk.

00:30:53.726 --> 00:30:56.562
When you fell off your bike. That's right.

00:30:56.563 --> 00:30:59.398
Remind me. What did you fall into again?
A knuckle sandwich?

00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:01.483
Hey, can you keep it down up there?

00:31:01.484 --> 00:31:04.654
I'm listening for a signal back here,
in case you forgot.

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:10.826
Who was it?
It was Andy and his goons, wasn't it?

00:31:10.827 --> 00:31:12.870
You poked the bear one too many times.

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:14.872
Your concern for me
is overwhelming, Steve.

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:16.498
My concern?

00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:19.835
I have shown nothing but concern for you
since forever,

00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:22.546
and I have been repeatedly ignored,
and now look what's happened.

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:24.006
We are totally screwed.

00:31:24.007 --> 00:31:26.049
Correction, we are screwed
because you don't know

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:29.011
how to do the most basic thing
like prevent a power surge.

00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:32.598
- See, this right here is your problem.
- It's the easiest thing in the world.

00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:35.058
- You can't admit you were wrong.
- My mother could prevent a surge.

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:37.352
- You can't admit it.
- Shockingly, I think your mother--

00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:39.605
Jesus Christ! Just do it for once!

00:31:39.606 --> 00:31:42.149
Just admit it, Henderson.
You're wrong! You screwed up!

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.153
Hey! Can you guys shut the hell up?

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:47.989
Jesus Christ.

00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:53.244
You two seem to be getting along.

00:31:53.828 --> 00:31:56.414
Yeah, well, in this case,
I actually like his suggestion.

00:31:57.582 --> 00:32:00.083
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- I don't wanna talk to you either.

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.044
Good.

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:04.505
Good.

00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:16.601
This is Dungeon Master
to Scout Battalion. Do you copy? Over.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:20.312
This is Dungeon Master to Scout Battalion.

00:32:20.313 --> 00:32:22.023
Do you copy? Over.

00:32:26.235 --> 00:32:32.075
This is Dungeon Master to Scout Battalion.
Do you copy? Over.

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:35.662
Great Scott!

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:39.498
- How long has that light been red?
- Oh. I don't know.

00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:42.417
Shit, shit, shit!
The flux capacitor is down again.

00:32:42.418 --> 00:32:44.252
- Is that bad?
- I mean, it could be.

00:32:44.253 --> 00:32:46.422
It's fixable, but it's a two-man job.

00:32:47.674 --> 00:32:48.716
Come on.

00:32:50.426 --> 00:32:51.552
We'll be right back.

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:56.014
Flux capacitor?

00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:58.767
Shh! I was lying, obviously.
That light is always red.

00:32:58.768 --> 00:33:00.560
Everything's totally fine, except...

00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:02.604
- Whoa.
- Except for your mom's plan.

00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:04.399
I mean, no offense to your mom,
but come on.

00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:07.651
The boys have already circled Zone G1,
like, five times.

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:11.155
Even if they miraculously find Hopper,
where does that get us exactly?

00:33:11.739 --> 00:33:13.949
I mean, Holly is still missing.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.327
Whereas your plan is genius.

00:33:17.328 --> 00:33:18.954
- You think so?
- Totally.

00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:21.581
You got an antenna in your head, use it.

00:33:21.582 --> 00:33:24.668
The Enigma machine won the war.
Knowledge is power.

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:27.295
- So...
- So... So, you want to...

00:33:27.296 --> 00:33:28.797
Skip school, play hooky,

00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:31.508
connect your brain into
an interdimensional monster's signal,

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:33.510
and save little Wheeler?

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:35.137
Yeah, kind of.

00:33:35.138 --> 00:33:38.265
I mean, your mom is gonna be raging mad,

00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:39.599
and she's probably right.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.059
It is super dangerous, but...

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.145
Isn't everything we do super dangerous?

00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:46.232
Precisely. So what do you say?

00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:50.902
This is Dungeon Master to Scout Battalion.

00:33:50.903 --> 00:33:51.946
Screw it.

00:34:02.165 --> 00:34:03.874
When were these taken?

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:05.417
Three hours ago, give or take.

00:34:05.418 --> 00:34:07.670
We've had sightings before.

00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:11.049
- Yes, but this time is different.
- Different.

00:34:11.674 --> 00:34:14.885
Don't interrupt me again
until you have her in custody.

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:17.764
She's here, Dr. Kay.

00:34:19.807 --> 00:34:21.809
What do you mean, "here"?

00:34:31.444 --> 00:34:33.987
Hey, come on. Slow down. Hang on.

00:34:33.988 --> 00:34:36.323
I found more blood. It must be close.

00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:39.660
Oh, you goddamn stubborn punk-ass...

00:34:42.872 --> 00:34:44.247
What are you doing?

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:45.415
We're gonna lose her.

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:48.251
It's just a cramp. It's just old age.
Just give me a second.

00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:50.254
- Hey.
- No, hey. Hey! Ahh!

00:34:53.508 --> 00:34:54.717
Looks worse than it is.

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.266
Where did you learn to do this?

00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:04.352
Max.

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:07.939
First clean, then disinfect, then bandage.

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:14.069
- Stop moving.
- Yeah, well, it stings. It stings!

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.905
That means it's working.

00:35:16.864 --> 00:35:19.116
You're more like me
than I'd like to admit.

00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:21.785
What, a stubborn punk-ass?

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:23.329
You heard that?

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:25.456
You talk loud.

00:35:28.292 --> 00:35:30.628
Yeah, I guess I am a stubborn punk-ass.

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:33.297
Or at least I was.

00:35:33.923 --> 00:35:36.175
I never listened to my pops either.

00:35:36.759 --> 00:35:38.885
Always thought I knew best.

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:40.179
Pissed him right off.

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:45.308
I remember one day it got so heated,
he took me to the recruitment office.

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:47.227
He made me enlist right there.

00:35:47.228 --> 00:35:51.190
He thought the Army would do me some good.
Give me some structure, discipline.

00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:56.320
The thing was,
I thought I was smarter than the officers.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:58.488
Were you?

00:35:58.489 --> 00:35:59.824
Sometimes.

00:36:00.449 --> 00:36:03.327
But mostly, no, I was just dumb.

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:04.996
Naive.

00:36:05.705 --> 00:36:08.416
I used to trust my gut and my instinct.

00:36:09.208 --> 00:36:11.586
Never... Like you.

00:36:13.379 --> 00:36:16.924
Did a lot of crazy things in that war.
Reckless things.

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.177
You might call them brave,

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:22.763
but there's a fine line
between bravery and stupidity.

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:25.850
Saw a lot of brave men die in that war.

00:36:26.934 --> 00:36:28.311
Friends of mine.

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:31.230
My daughter...

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.357
Sara.

00:36:33.983 --> 00:36:35.526
She was brave.

00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:45.620
Bravest person I ever knew.

00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:51.250
She stared death in the face.
She never got scared. She never wavered.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.711
Fought her heart out.

00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:56.839
The doctors said
they never saw anything like it.

00:36:58.341 --> 00:37:00.676
They thought she was gonna make it too.

00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:19.695
So, that's why you don't want me in here?

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:24.074
Because you think Vecna will win,

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:25.242
and I will die?

00:37:25.243 --> 00:37:26.327
I don't think...

00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:29.288
I don't think anything. I've just...

00:37:32.124 --> 00:37:34.669
Just been around long enough to know that...

00:37:37.046 --> 00:37:39.382
you can't count on anything in this life.

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.847
I don't want to lose you.

00:37:50.559 --> 00:37:51.477
I won't.

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.814
Which is why whatever happens
from here on out,

00:37:55.815 --> 00:37:57.649
wherever this blood leads,

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.652
I need you to do what I say.

00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:03.281
So don't be a stubborn punk-ass like you?

00:38:03.864 --> 00:38:06.158
Yeah, don't be a stubborn punk-ass.

00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:20.006
Hey, hey, hey!

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:22.091
I lead.

00:38:40.401 --> 00:38:44.071
So sorry to disturb you, Doctor,
but it's the Wheeler children.

00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:46.323
What about them?

00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:48.700
They say they need to speak to you.
They say it's--

00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:49.784
An emergency!

00:38:49.785 --> 00:38:50.994
What kind of emergency?

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:53.455
Our... Our sister,
she's missing, as you know.

00:38:53.456 --> 00:38:55.332
I understand. And I'm very sorry.

00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:57.375
Well, we think our mom has something.

00:38:57.376 --> 00:38:58.668
Or knows something.

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:00.503
About our sister,
about finding our sister.

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.839
And I wish I could get you in to see her.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.926
But your mother's recovering from surgery.
Her system is still in shock.

00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:10.388
And beyond that,
her larynx is extremely damaged.

00:39:10.389 --> 00:39:13.350
She wouldn't be able to talk,
even if she were awake.

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:15.852
Right, but even so--

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:17.146
Listen to me.

00:39:17.813 --> 00:39:20.774
Finding your mother
when you did saved her life.

00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:22.109
Let's not risk it now.

00:39:23.319 --> 00:39:24.695
All right, sweetheart.

00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:29.909
What now?

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:35.538
So we need to change sheets in 307.

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:39.459
Rooms 202 and 203 are vacant.
And they need mopping.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.336
Denise needs help later...

00:39:41.337 --> 00:39:44.339
- What?
- Come on.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.174
- What are we doing?
- Ignoring doctor's orders.

00:39:46.175 --> 00:39:48.719
- He said it's too risky.
- When has that stopped us before?

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.597
Besides, did you smell his breath?

00:39:52.598 --> 00:39:54.475
I don't trust doctors who smoke...

00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:56.435
or call me "sweetheart."

00:40:11.325 --> 00:40:15.121
Hey, man, I'm gonna turn on Irwin.
One more loop around the zone?

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.957
Yeah. Go ahead.

00:40:23.003 --> 00:40:25.423
No, wait. Scratch that.

00:40:26.132 --> 00:40:27.258
I think I got something.

00:40:27.842 --> 00:40:29.134
- Seriously?
- Is it Hop?

00:40:29.135 --> 00:40:32.470
Yeah, I... I don't know.
I'm not getting a hit on the decoder,

00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:34.098
but I can hear something.

00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:36.725
Yeah, I definitely hear something.

00:40:46.235 --> 00:40:47.278
Is that him?

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.321
Yo, dude!

00:40:51.365 --> 00:40:52.908
Yeah, uh, we're not sure.

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:57.620
- No, it's not Hop.
- What? Then what the hell is it?

00:40:57.621 --> 00:40:59.873
I don't know.
It could be a million things.

00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:03.668
Military broadcast, TV channel,
any EMI within our frequency zone.

00:41:03.669 --> 00:41:06.087
I do know it's not Hop's telemetry tag,

00:41:06.088 --> 00:41:09.424
because if it was,
it would show up on the decoder.

00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:11.802
So... search continues.

00:41:15.222 --> 00:41:18.517
Hey, Mom, um, disregard.
It's a false alarm.

00:41:19.727 --> 00:41:22.061
Jonathan, is your receiver
in any way connected

00:41:22.062 --> 00:41:23.814
to the flux capacitor?

00:41:25.524 --> 00:41:28.902
Uh, sorry, Mom.
Can, uh... Can you repeat that?

00:41:28.903 --> 00:41:30.278
The flux capacitor.

00:41:30.279 --> 00:41:31.696
Robin said it was down,

00:41:31.697 --> 00:41:33.740
but she and Will are working on it.

00:41:33.741 --> 00:41:36.076
I wanted to make sure
it wasn't messing with your connection.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.121
Hello?

00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:42.500
Hello?

00:41:58.891 --> 00:42:02.144
You know, we can still turn back
if you want.

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:05.980
I'm more scared of my mom at this point,
to be honest.

00:42:05.981 --> 00:42:07.233
Fair.

00:42:17.159 --> 00:42:18.994
Is this where it happened?

00:42:21.497 --> 00:42:22.957
Where you had your vision?

00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:27.878
Yeah. Right here.

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:33.092
Are you... feeling anything?

00:42:34.593 --> 00:42:35.594
No.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.181
What...

00:42:42.017 --> 00:42:44.394
So, what are we doing now, exactly?

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:48.523
If your theory's right,
and my receiver is proximity-based,

00:42:48.524 --> 00:42:51.818
I need to get close to the Demo
to tap into the hive mind.

00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:55.655
And maybe, earlier,
when the Demo was passing by,

00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:58.074
it was headed for its monster lair.

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.784
Right. Monster lair.

00:42:59.785 --> 00:43:02.329
We're already here.
Might as well push our luck.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.506
I've been meaning to ask you,
were you at the hospital yesterday?

00:43:13.507 --> 00:43:14.633
The hospital?

00:43:15.134 --> 00:43:16.676
No. No, no, no.

00:43:16.677 --> 00:43:21.307
Weird. I could have sworn
I saw you there, but...

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.391
Vickie, she's a candy striper...

00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:24.809
- Oh yeah.
- She's my friend.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:27.438
We're friends. Good friends. But, uh...

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:31.650
The thing is, some people
might not understand our friendship.

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:36.112
Basically, what I'm trying to say is
if you were there and did see something,

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:39.533
it might just be better if,
uh, nobody knew,

00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:41.367
if it stayed between us.

00:43:41.368 --> 00:43:42.702
I didn't see anything.

00:43:42.703 --> 00:43:46.289
Sorry. It's just
I tend to be off-topic when I'm nervous,

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:48.958
and you said that thing
about monster lair, and I thought,

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:52.086
"What if your mom was right,
and you get kidnapped by Vecna, and..."

00:43:52.087 --> 00:43:53.380
Holy shit.

00:43:54.089 --> 00:43:56.215
What... Where are you going?

00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:59.677
It's a mandala. Did you do this,
Mrs. Harris's class, fifth grade?

00:43:59.678 --> 00:44:03.306
So cool. Though, come to think of it,
it's not even really a mandala.

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:06.351
I mean, it's just a spiral.
Mandalas are usually concentric circles

00:44:06.352 --> 00:44:08.436
but it's the thought that counts.

00:44:08.437 --> 00:44:10.021
Speaking of the thought that counts,

00:44:10.022 --> 00:44:14.777
is it a mandala,
or a mandah-la, or a man-dala?

00:44:17.863 --> 00:44:19.823
- I heard laughter.
- What?

00:44:20.908 --> 00:44:22.034
In my vision.

00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:25.245
Kids laughing, playing.

00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:32.127
What does that have to do
with a monster lair? Will!

00:44:49.978 --> 00:44:51.772
That's not a Demogorgon.

00:44:52.898 --> 00:44:54.274
Stay close to me.

00:45:04.827 --> 00:45:05.703
Hop?

00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:10.958
Jesus Christ.

00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:15.546
What is it?

00:45:38.986 --> 00:45:40.404
Holly was here.

00:45:43.699 --> 00:45:44.825
Right here.

00:45:48.287 --> 00:45:50.914
Maybe that's why
I can't find her in my mind.

00:45:52.833 --> 00:45:54.168
It took her...

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:57.337
through the wall.

00:46:36.585 --> 00:46:37.836
Incoming, incoming.

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:40.713
- Limp or something.
- What?

00:46:40.714 --> 00:46:41.757
Limp!

00:46:43.425 --> 00:46:44.801
...to New England?

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:46.719
Oh, it is amazing.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.971
Don't look back.

00:46:48.847 --> 00:46:51.557
- What kind of limp is that?
- It's a limp, a regular limp.

00:46:51.558 --> 00:46:52.476
Whoa.

00:47:10.202 --> 00:47:11.411
Hi, Mom.

00:47:12.788 --> 00:47:15.374
Mom, can you hear us, Mom?

00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:20.087
Mom?

00:47:21.129 --> 00:47:22.256
Can you hear me?

00:47:24.591 --> 00:47:25.592
Mom.

00:47:31.056 --> 00:47:31.932
Hi.

00:47:32.724 --> 00:47:34.225
Hi there.

00:47:34.226 --> 00:47:35.768
Hi, Mom.

00:47:35.769 --> 00:47:37.271
Hey, Mom.

00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:40.231
Don't try to talk.

00:47:40.232 --> 00:47:43.276
It's your throat. It's gonna be okay.
It needs time to heal.

00:47:43.277 --> 00:47:44.361
Yeah.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.116
But could you... could you maybe write?

00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:53.244
Yeah? Okay.

00:47:53.245 --> 00:47:54.329
Okay.

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:13.515
"Holly?"

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.143
Yeah, that's, um...

00:48:16.935 --> 00:48:18.729
That is why we're here, Mom.

00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:20.564
Holly's...

00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:24.776
She's missing.

00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:29.614
Hey, we're gonna get her back.

00:48:29.615 --> 00:48:31.032
We just need your help.

00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:33.618
We think there's someone
that knows where Holly is,

00:48:33.619 --> 00:48:35.828
who knows why she was taken
and where she is.

00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:37.830
We just don't know where he is.

00:48:37.831 --> 00:48:40.459
And so, we're hoping that you might.

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.385
"Who?"

00:48:50.969 --> 00:48:51.970
Um...

00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:58.268
We don't know his name, but Holly, she...

00:49:00.687 --> 00:49:02.773
she calls him Mr. Whatsit.

00:49:16.912 --> 00:49:17.829
Come on.

00:49:18.872 --> 00:49:20.998
I don't understand.
What exactly are we doing here?

00:49:20.999 --> 00:49:23.585
We're looking for this.

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:30.883
"Teacher saw talking to W."

00:49:30.884 --> 00:49:32.719
"W" as in "Whatsit"?

00:49:35.389 --> 00:49:36.223
"Nobody..."

00:49:39.267 --> 00:49:40.143
"...there."

00:49:41.019 --> 00:49:43.230
In my vision earlier,
the sky was spinning.

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:46.691
So, I think I was here,

00:49:46.692 --> 00:49:49.903
right here on this merry-go-round
during Ms. Harris's recess.

00:49:51.071 --> 00:49:52.238
Blast off!

00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:53.865
Derek, stop!

00:49:54.408 --> 00:49:56.368
Stop, Derek! Get off! Go away!

00:49:57.244 --> 00:50:00.204
I don't understand. I thought you were
seeing through the Demogorgon.

00:50:00.205 --> 00:50:01.122
I know. So did I.

00:50:01.123 --> 00:50:03.749
But you said yourself
Vecna controls the hive mind,

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:07.336
which means he's a part of it too.
So, when he searches for his victims...

00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:09.880
- He invades their minds.
- He sees what they see.

00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:13.676
Did Holly ever describe
Mr. Whatsit to you?

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:18.348
Like, maybe what he's wearing
or anything like that?

00:50:19.307 --> 00:50:22.269
Holly, time for breakfast.

00:50:24.312 --> 00:50:25.188
"Pocket watch."

00:50:26.606 --> 00:50:28.734
"Tall. Vest."

00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:31.360
Okay, he wears a vest.

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:35.364
Uh, he's gentle and kind.

00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:40.786
So, what if I was seeing
through the eyes of Vecna's next victim,

00:50:40.787 --> 00:50:44.415
this victim he's stalking,
which means I was seeing through--

00:50:44.416 --> 00:50:45.584
Holly's eyes.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.169
But if that's true, it would mean...

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:49.296
I was him.

00:50:50.505 --> 00:50:51.506
I was Vecna.

00:50:54.509 --> 00:50:57.304
Did Holly ever say if he has a first name?

00:51:02.851 --> 00:51:04.227
Are the others here yet?

00:51:05.937 --> 00:51:06.897
No, not yet.

00:51:08.607 --> 00:51:12.778
You will save them, too, won't you?
Save them from the monsters?

00:51:13.653 --> 00:51:18.658
Yes, Holly. Don't you worry.
I'm going to save your friends.

00:51:22.037 --> 00:51:23.205
Every last one of them.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.628
And my family?

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.380
Are they coming too?

00:51:40.722 --> 00:51:42.015
Your friends first.

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:45.477
Then after, I'll save your family too,
of course.

00:51:47.187 --> 00:51:49.022
I have room for everyone here.

00:52:12.337 --> 00:52:14.339
Mr. Sandman

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.466
Bring me a dream

00:52:17.342 --> 00:52:21.387
Make him the cutest
That I've ever seen

00:52:21.388 --> 00:52:26.016
Give him two lips
Like roses and clover

00:52:26.017 --> 00:52:29.770
Then tell him that
His lonesome nights are over

00:52:29.771 --> 00:52:31.231
Sandman

00:52:32.357 --> 00:52:34.775
I'm so alone

00:52:34.776 --> 00:52:37.988
Don't have nobody to call my own

00:52:38.864 --> 00:52:42.575
Please turn on your magic beam

00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:46.121
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

00:53:04.222 --> 00:53:09.226
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

00:53:09.227 --> 00:53:13.314
Make him the cutest
That I've ever seen

00:53:13.315 --> 00:53:17.318
Give him the word that I'm not a rover

00:53:17.319 --> 00:53:21.197
Then tell him that
His lonesome nights are over

00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:25.409
Sandman, I'm so alone

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:29.496
Don't have nobody to call my own

00:53:29.497 --> 00:53:32.499
Please turn on your magic beam

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:36.713
Ah, Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

00:53:50.018 --> 00:53:51.685
Mr. Sandman

00:53:51.686 --> 00:53:52.811
Yes?

00:53:52.812 --> 00:53:54.396
Bring us a dream

00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:58.692
Give him a pair of eyes
With a come-hither gleam

00:53:58.693 --> 00:54:03.864
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci

00:54:03.865 --> 00:54:07.744
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:12.623
- Mr. Sandman, someone to hold
- Someone to hold

00:54:12.624 --> 00:54:16.085
Would be so peachy
Before we're too old

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:20.422
So please turn on your magic beam

00:54:20.423 --> 00:54:24.386
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

00:54:29.182 --> 00:54:31.809
Mr. Sandman, bring us

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.602
Please, please, please

00:54:33.603 --> 00:54:36.230
Mr. Sandman

00:54:36.231 --> 00:54:42.404
Bring us a dream
