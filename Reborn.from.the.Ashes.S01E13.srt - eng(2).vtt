[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 13]

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.920
Don't!

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.750
What are you doing?

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.390
As long as Su Qingran lives,

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.430
there will be no peace.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.000
At first, having you sell her
to the Begonia House

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.890
was meant to disgrace her,
so she couldn't return to the Su Family,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.200
but unexpectedly,
she became the crown princess

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.170
and opposed me at every turn.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.390
Get rid of her quickly,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.890
before things get out of hand.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.490
I think you've lost your mind.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.560
You want me to kill the crown princess?

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.480
Do you know how heavily guarded it is?

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.840
If I step inside,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.280
I'll be shot like a porcupine.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.710
You just want a new lover, don't you?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.660
Say it straight.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.950
Don't beat around the bush.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.230
Useless thing.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.950
Is it enough?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.350
Can you let me go now?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.600
You're here to investigate
Ye Changyuan too?

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.710
You deliberately lured me here.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.870
You are truly clever.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.950
Since our goals align,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.920
why not work together?

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.920
What do you say?

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.710
What leverage do you have
to bargain with me?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.760
I know your secret.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.920
Fine.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.400
We can't deal with Ye Changyuan yet.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.000
I want to use him as bait

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.070
to catch a bigger fish.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.510
We work together
to track Ye Changyuan's trail.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.870
Then,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.920
we each take what we need.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.250
Pleasure working with you.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.680
Wanyan Jin is indeed planning
to act against Su Guang.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.630
Wait until he kills Su Guang,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.590
then I'll find another chance

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.680
to get the account book.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.030
My Lord,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.000
are we really going to work
with the crown princess?

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.840
I need to secure her first.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.630
Don't let her recklessness

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.190
ruin my plan.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.710
I think

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.280
you're not just trying to secure her.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.910
Then why?

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.000
He has feelings for the crown princess
and worries for her safety.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.120
Bai Ling,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.190
hit him ten times with a stick.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.150
Yes, My Lord.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.240
My Lord, I dare not
speak carelessly anymore.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.150
Wanyan Jin

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.740
has been going out early
and coming back late these days.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.520
There's definitely something going on.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.800
Qingran.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.150
Where have you been these few days?

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.750
Handling official matters.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.260
I don't know what kind
of official business

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.750
must be handled at Begonia House.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.680
Begonia House?

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.930
Have you been at Begonia House
these past few days?

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.520
Qingran, perhaps you don't know it.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.690
Jin has recently become obsessed

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.080
with the song and dance there.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.260
He insists on attending every day
to show support.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.750
With your condition,

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.560
even if you wanted to go,
you wouldn't be able to enjoy it.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.190
As long as he's willing to come home,
that's enough.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.390
Qingran, you really are understanding.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.430
I am his wife.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.190
He is the closest person to me.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.480
No matter what he does,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.680
I will always support him.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.480
Right?

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.430
Honey.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.270
You are really understanding.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.310
Qi,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.510
anything else you want to say?

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.000
Hmph.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.720
This Su Qingran

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.630
not only has a face
as repulsive as Wen Yueqian's,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.480
but she's just as unbearable as her.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.360
Speak up.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.890
What have you found out
at Begonia House these past days?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.600
What is there to find out there?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.800
I was merely there
to enjoy the song and dance.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.870
You speak differently from your actions.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.920
You said you want to cooperate with me,

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.190
but in reality, you tell me nothing.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.750
You're overthinking.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.000
Where has Wanyan Jin been hiding?

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.950
Why is it her?

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.870
Someone,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.070
bring that lady up here.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.510
Don't let others see you.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.000
May I ask

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.270
your name?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.190
Isn't this Miss Qianyue?

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.120
You've taken up your old trade again?

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.800
It is all because

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.550
that my husband leaves me alone
in an empty room every night,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.510
so I have no choice
but to find some fun.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.510
Qingran,

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.630
are you expressing your displeasure
with me?

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.120
Wanyan Jin, that's enough.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.750
Please cooperate with me.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.160
You said you came here
not to investigate the case.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.360
Spit it out.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.340
What have you found out
about Ye Changyuan?

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.680
Ye Changyuan appears to be a musician
at Begonia House.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.850
But behind the scenes,
he's trafficking gunpowder.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.190
Trafficking gunpowder?

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.190
So Su Guang, Ye Changyuan,
and Concubine Gong...

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.190
If that's the case,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.000

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.800
