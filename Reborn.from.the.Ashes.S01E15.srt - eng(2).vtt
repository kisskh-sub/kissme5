[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 15]

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.680
You're not my little niece.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.710
You've grown up into a fine young lady.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.590
Girls really do change as they grow.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.380
You're even more beautiful than before.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.840
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.840
Uncle.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.550
I wonder how the crown prince
treats you.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.960
He is lucky to have you for his wife.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.640
Uncle, he's been good to me.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.710
That's good.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.110
If the crown prince ever mistreats you,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.360
I will never let him go.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.640
Uncle, let's sit and talk.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.110
Alright.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.640
Please.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.510
Here.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.150
My Lady.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.600
I personally

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.150
sent Gong to the nunnery.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.470
You didn't see it just now.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.880
She's living a miserable life now.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.790
It's truly satisfying.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.320
She has been tyrannizing Su Mansion
for years.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.830
Now she's become a nun.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.140
She brought this on herself.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.520
She actually had an affair
with that musician.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.630
What?

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.880
Su Guang was betrayed?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.630
Hmm.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.800
That's right.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.910
No one expected Gong
to be interested in Ye Changyuan.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.830
But Ye Changyuan is quite handsome.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.270
With smooth, delicate skin.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.880
Gong couldn't resist.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.320
Su Guang caught them red-handed.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.630
The Master has always acted
so high and mighty.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.040
Now he has been greatly humiliated
because of Gong.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.240
Anyone would be furious.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.390
The person who betrayed Su Guang
is Ye Changyuan?

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.110
Yeah.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.160
Uncle,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.960
you know Ye Changyuan?

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.630
We have some business dealings.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.040
Sometimes Su Guang lets him
deliver goods with us to the border.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.320
By the way, Qingran,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.110
I brought you the chestnut pastries
you loved most when you were a child.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.470
The trip was a bit long.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.590
I wonder if they've cooled off
completely.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.350
Chestnut pastries taste best
when it's warm.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.270
Here.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.600
Take a bite.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.520
Chestnut pastries.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.550
Here.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.470
Here.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.040
Thank you, Uncle.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.400
Is it good?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.600
Hmm.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.350
Zhijin, look.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.890
There are still people in this world
who care about you

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.120
and love you.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.910
Honey, what do you think of this?

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.600
Qingran.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.280
Qingran, come here.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.170
I tell you something.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.400
What is it, Uncle?

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.440
What's going on?

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.350
Qingran,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.440
all these years, I've been managing
your mother's dowry.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.750
This is the income from the shops
your mother left behind over time.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.120
Take a look.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.950
That's it?

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.670
Yes.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.400
Uncle, I've told you before.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.320
You don't need to report these to me.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.750
You can handle it yourself.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.000
No.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.910
This dowry was given to you
by your mother.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.430
How can you not oversee it yourself?

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.720
I am now the crown princess.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.050
I have no worries
about food, clothing, or expenses.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.510
Besides,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.350
these were never really mine.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.710
They belong to the Chu Family.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.200
If it really doesn't work out,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.880
just think of it as keeping it for me.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.630
Just like your mother,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840
you're too kind-hearted.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.880
You have to have the confidence

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.840
that makes the in-laws respect you.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.120
Tell me

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.690
whether this guy has ever bullied you.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.230
Uncle.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.840
Don't worry.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.950
As long as I am here,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.510
no one can lay a hand on her.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.040
You agree,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.190
right?

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.440
Exactly.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.600
He has always treated me well.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.280
He would never

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.280
choke me, poison me, threaten me,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.190
or test me.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.190
Is that right,

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.070
honey?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.470
Yes.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.670
Qingran has also been very kind to me.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.840
She's never hurt me with a hairpin,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.880
never pushed me off a cliff,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.000
and would never

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.840
use me, deceive me or frame me.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.230
Am I right,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.720
honey?

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.230
Are you

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.400
being sarcastic?

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.990
No.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.310
Are you both

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.870
unhappy?

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.400
No.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.760
Then you...

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.990
We're doing fine.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.080
We have something important
to attend to soon.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.520
We'll be leaving now.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.200
Just leaving like that?

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.310
Hey, the Account Ledger?

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.630
This is the confidence you have
from your maiden home.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.310
Qingran.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.720
[Suoqing Palace]

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.960
Boss, we've found out.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.350
It was Su Qingran who leaked
your affair with Concubine Gong.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.110
Su Qingran?

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.600
How dare you hurt me?

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.910
You'll learn what it costs to anger me.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.400
I will make sure to settle this score.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.640
Where is this place?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.840
Your Highness, you have woken up.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.990
Where are you going?

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.230
Why hasn't Qingran returned yet?

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.870
My Lord,

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.110
I'm sorry.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.670
I was careless for a moment.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.990
Her Highness

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.080
has gone missing.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.760
What?

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.400
It's you.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.840
You are the crown princess?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.760
Since you know I'm the crown princess,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.870
why don't you let me go?

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.870
If you were the crown princess,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.200
I would be cautious.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.110
But you

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.960
aren't the real Su Qingran.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.670
Am I right?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.430
Hmph!

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.470
So you still remember.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.640
If it weren't for you,

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.960
she would never have died.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.520
So what?

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.640
I could have control over that fool.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.670
Today, I am able to take you down.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.080
Ye Changyuan,

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.230
the crown prince will be here soon.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:35.790
You all

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.440
might as well think about
how much longer you can live.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.640
Ah.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.550
I want to see if,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.670
with so many ambushes,

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.230
he can get in or not.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.600
You all,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.600
make sure to entertain

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.760
the crown princess well tonight.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.520
How dare you

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.160
lay a hand on her?

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.080
Charge!

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.760
