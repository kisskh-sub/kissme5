00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.580
suffered for years.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:46.850
Every student

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.250
from our year at the school
knows about this.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.130
Seems real.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:49.980
Fell from grace.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.700
I actually know the person
in this scandal.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.940
We're not just gossiping randomly.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.130
We only go for the juicy stuff!

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.010
That was fast.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:55.940
Thumbs up to the post.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.820
Look, so many people know about it.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.370
Hello, Yuan.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:14.420
Siting.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.770
You...

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.980
You've seen what's online, right?

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:23.820
Don't worry.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.770
I'll find out who did this.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.580
And I won't let them get away with it.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.820
I'll make them
apologize to you publicly online.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.130
Yuan,

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.580
usually, these netizens
have the attention span of a goldfish.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.300
If I just ignore it,

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.060
it'll blow over quickly.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.060
I don't think you need to

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.250
worry about this.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.250
I'm hanging up then.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.220
Mr. Feng,

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.130
I suggest

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.850
Ms. Tan issue

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.700
a formal lawyer's letter immediately,

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.100
demanding the rumor-mongers
take down the posts

00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.700
and related videos.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.100
In the age of social media,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.820
information spreads too fast online.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.770
Staying silent

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.010
will be very damaging to Ms. Tan.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.850
I understand.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.010
Please draft the content, Mr. Zhu.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.180
Then we'll decide when to send it.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:13.940
The sooner, the better.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.460
They haven't used your name directly,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.460
but every detail points to you.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.130
There's a lot of nasty gossip out there.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.250
What do you

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.770
want to do?

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.250
Should we

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.250
make a statement to clarify?

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.530
Let's not engage for now.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.250
Aren't they always saying

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.100
netizens have short memories?

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.980
I'm hoping this will all blow over soon.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.730
What's Feng Rui's stance?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.980
He wants to keep pushing
to find the source.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:46.610
Don't you

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.610
want to give him a chance?

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.460
And give yourself one too?

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.180
This time,

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.370
why don't you try trusting him?

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.770
Feng Rui,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.730
actually, I think

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.700
this whole thing

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:05.770
will blow over soon.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.530
We both know the truth.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:11.850
It's slander.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.180
But I really don't want you

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.890
or Le to get hurt because of me.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:18.730
Especially Le.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.060
All these years,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.460
I haven't been there
to take care of him for a single day.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.700
If a child so young

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.250
has to bear this pressure
because of my issues,

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.820
I'd rather die.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.180
I wasn't there for you back then.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.610
It's different now.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.100
Don't worry.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.820
This won't affect Le.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.580
Trust me.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:49.980
Everything will get back on track.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.340
[Cygne]

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.180
Qi,

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.300
Tan Siting sent a lawyer's letter.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.740
I told you things would turn around.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:02.860
Really?

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.300
Yeah.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.180
Because it's getting more serious now.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.460
Look at these netizens.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.500
I saw this outside the studio

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.660
after the show recently.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:10.940
Who...

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.540
Who's this poor sucker now?

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.100
Looks like the conniving woman
found herself a nice guy.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.140
What slick moves.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.460
Oh my god, the scandal
involves someone I know!

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.540
I know that man!

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.460
Really?

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.940
Who is it? Spill the tea.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.420
That man is a big boss.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:25.620
He's not

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.780
the sugar daddy funding her, is he?

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.900
What do we do?

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.300
I just hope this gets resolved smoothly.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:39.460
Doctor.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.940
The test results will take some time.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.700
Have a seat and rest here.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:46.020
Okay.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:46.860
Okay.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:47.780
Thank you.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:48.580
You're welcome.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.180
What do you mean by that?

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.180
I

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.940
am not playing that game.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.460
I just don't like Tan Siting.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.020
I never wanted to ruin her.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:19.900
We're even.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:39.980
Are you okay?

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:42.940
You're here.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.020
You weren't answering my calls

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.220
or replying to my texts.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.020
Hello, your order is ready.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.260
Thank you.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.660
Enjoy.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.460
Here are the chopsticks.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.740
I went to your place looking for you.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.300
Where have you been?

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.500
You haven't been home for days.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.540
Shuhan,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.300
I've made mistakes in business too.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.380
It's normal to meet the wrong people.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:09.900
You don't need to take it to heart.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.180
Don't blame yourself so much.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.380
I wanted to succeed so badly.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.940
Wanted to prove myself so much.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:19.660
I know.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.580
You're excellent.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.300
You have to believe in yourself.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:32.860
Remember?

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.420
This is the place

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.580
we had our first date.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.100
Back then,

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.740
I thought the noodles here were amazing.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.940
But today, they just

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:47.820
taste ordinary.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.980
Maybe it's just your imagination.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.140
This bank card

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.060
has the penalty fee
from the East District project.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.300
I messed it up.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.420
I have to make up for it.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.420
Shuhan.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.340
Oh,

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.700
you're buying

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.700
the noodles today.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.060
Come on.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:16.780
Eat up.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:47.860
Zu.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.780
Let's break up.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.900
The time I've spent with you

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.420
has been the happiest of my life.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.020
But this is as far

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.460
as we can go.

I object!

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.460
For the school's reputation?

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.260

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.580
who only knows how to spend money,

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.340
make stupid investments,
and get scammed!

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.020
Shuhan,

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.700
we're family!

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.020
Is that how you see me?

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.460
Siting is your best friend.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:44.820
You know

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.300
all her worst,
most embarrassing moments!

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.900
And in the end, you do this to her?

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.140
Siting.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:55.940
Siting.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.940
She's the goddess in your eyes,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.340
right?

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.220
Untouchable.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.060
And me?

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:01.700
As your sister,

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.700
I'm only fit to drop out early
and earn your tuition?

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:04.580
Wang Zeyuan,

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.340
in your eyes,

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.300
I'm not even a fraction of her, right?

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.580
I know you've been wronged.

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.580
So when I could,

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.220
I tried my best to meet
all your demands.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.100
If it wasn't enough,

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:31.820
you could've told me.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.940
Why did you have to do this to her?

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:37.780
Our family issues

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.780
have nothing to do with her.

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.180
That's right.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.420
Since I was little, I was taught

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.420
that you were the son,

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.420
and all the best things
should come to you first.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:50.940
And Yuan,

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.060
you're outstanding.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.540
Our family is counting on you
to be successful.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.060
So whenever Mom and Dad favored you

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.940
and expected me to give you
all the good things,

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.700
I did so without hesitation

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.700
and gladly.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:02.580
But

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.060
today, because of an outsider,

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.300
you come in and start accusing

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:05.900
and questioning me!

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:06.900
Have you ever thought

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:07.780
why I

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.180
went this far?

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.420
Why did I do something like this today?

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:44.420
Siting.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:47.900
Siting, you're here.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.020
You came at the right time.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:51.940
Come on.

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:52.900
Sit.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.220
Have a drink with me.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:55.620
Go on, drink.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.340
No.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.740
Let's sit down and have a talk.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:03.460
Okay.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.300
Sit down and talk.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:08.860
Sit and talk.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.860
Why did you do it?

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.140
Why?

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.340
You and Yuan both came in

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.340
asking why.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.020
A million whys.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:29.580
Yuan,

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.540
you told her?

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.100
He didn't.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.460
I didn't need anyone to tell me.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.900
You're the only one who knew

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.340
all the details of what happened

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.100
twelve years ago.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.540
You finally figured out it was me.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:48.980
Took you long enough.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.220
Shuhan, I really never expected this.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.740
We've been friends for years.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.260
I shared everything with you.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.540
And you did this to me.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:07.660
Why?

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.460
Because I was jealous.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.500
Want to know when it started?

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.620
Do you remember
at the Queen Ballet audition,

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.220
what happened with your dance shoes?

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.340
Feel it. Hands.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.340
Open.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:38.900
Good.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.380
Fingertips.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.140
Okay. Class is over.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.700
Tan Siting, you stay.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.220
I think it's okay.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:50.780
Alright.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:52.380
Okay.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:54.620
Push back.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.100
Yes.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.260
[Tan Siting]

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.100
How did your audition go?

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.620
Probably didn't get it.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:34.620
What happened?

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.020
[Star House]
Someone tampered with my dance shoes.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.180
I've been jealous of you
since we were kids.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:45.940
I was jealous

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.700
that you always had people around you
who liked you,

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.740
praised you,
and even loved you unconditionally.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.500
And now I'm even more jealous of you!

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.940
Why do you get to have everything?

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:55.820
And me?

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.620
My parents always thought I was useless.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.660
Now that I'm older, I'm just
a burden to Wang Zeyuan.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.380
I even messed up my relationship.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:03.820
Now I don't even

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.060
have a home!

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.580
So just because your life is a mess,

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.820
you want to drag mine

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.220
down to your level?

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:22.380
But

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.220
I don't believe it.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:26.380
We've been friends

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.140
for years.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.300
I told you everything.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.500
You were there for me
during my hardest times.

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:34.980
You talked with me,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.940
drank with me,

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.340
and cried with me.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.500
Was all of that fake?

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.140
Just because of jealousy,

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.700
you destroyed a friend
who was like family?

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.940
What good does this do,

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:53.860
besides letting you vent?

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.220
It does good.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.140
It's money.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.140
You both know.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.500
Because I got scammed,

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.500
Zu's company

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.820
has to pay

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.580
a penalty.

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.940
But I have nothing now.

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.380
How am I supposed to
pay that money back?

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.460
You get money for...

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:16.580
slandering her?

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.980
Gao Hui approached you?

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.820
I went to her.

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.700
Are you insane, Wang Shuhan?

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.700
If you needed money,

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.980
you could've come to me!

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.940
I'd sell the company

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.340
to get you the money!

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.220
How could I, Yuan?

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.460
You're our parents' golden child.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.980
You're the pillar of our family.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.100
How could I let you sell the company

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.460
to pay

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:49.900
my debt?

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.220
Did Zu

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.620
pressure you to pay him back?

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:54.700
No.

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:56.740
It's precisely because he didn't

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.460
that I have to pay this money back.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.380
You know?

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:02.940
Since I was little,

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.060
I felt no one truly loved me,

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.620
cared about me,

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.260
or even asked what I really wanted.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.060
All my past boyfriends

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.260
either cheated me out of money

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.740
or my feelings.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.260
Until I met Zu.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.500
I know his feelings for me are real.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.740
I know he genuinely cares for me.

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.620
So in this world,

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.980
the person I owe the most to is him.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.100
If I can't pay back this money,

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.420
I'd rather die.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.860
So, for Zu,

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.940
you betrayed me?

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.100
Not just this time.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:47.420
You know?

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.700
I knew Le was your child
a long time ago.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.900
And twelve years ago, Le didn't die.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.660
But I didn't tell you.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:00.380
That was for money too.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.900
Wang Shuhan, you're despicable.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.380
Am I despicable?

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.380
Am I?

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.620
Where do you think the money

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.380
for your game company's
first investment came from?

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:20.380
Shuhan,

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.340
can you keep this a secret for me now?

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.620
Okay. I understand.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:07.620

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:09.900
