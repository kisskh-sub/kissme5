HEROES NEXT DOOR

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:43.065
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:44.066
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.067
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

00:00:46.026 --> 00:00:47.444
I'll be asking the questions here.

00:00:49.863 --> 00:00:51.990
Did you give the order to abduct my wife?

00:00:54.993 --> 00:00:57.120
That's right. I did.

00:00:58.163 --> 00:00:59.206
Why?

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:00.707
Why do you think?

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:03.043
To get you, of course.

00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:06.129
Who set off the bombs in Changri-dong?

00:01:07.214 --> 00:01:09.591
That's none of your business.

00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:11.301
I told you. Don't make me repeat myself.

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:16.139
It was Sullivan! It was Jame Sullivan!

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:22.229
I confirmed
that Sullivan bought the bombs.

00:01:26.358 --> 00:01:27.526
Watch out!

00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:30.529
My Myeong-o...

00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:33.990
- Where did you get that ice cream?
- That man gave me ice cream.

00:01:34.074 --> 00:01:36.368
Guess who we ran into on our way home?

00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:37.285
Sullivan.

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.162
YOU'RE MAKING THINGS COMPLICATED
JDD SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES, CHOI KANG

00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:48.463
You've got the wrong guy.

00:01:50.173 --> 00:01:51.299
Who says?

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:11.653
I'm not dead?

00:02:13.155 --> 00:02:14.197
I'm alive?

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.534
Oh, that hurts!

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:18.952
Oh, gosh, I'm alive!

00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:20.662
Man, that hurts.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.331
But I'm alive!

00:02:23.415 --> 00:02:24.374
What's this?

00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:29.004
What the...

00:02:32.883 --> 00:02:35.469
Why, that bastard!

00:02:36.303 --> 00:02:37.429
Where did he go?

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.312
What's going on?

00:02:46.605 --> 00:02:48.064
Minister Kim Seok-jun.

00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:50.942
You're under arrest for violating

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:54.029
the Military Supplies Management Act
and the Specific Crimes Punishment Act.

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:55.781
Under arrest?

00:02:56.907 --> 00:02:57.949
Me?

00:03:04.581 --> 00:03:06.875
Gosh, this hurts so much.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.962
I need to see a doctor first.

00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.244
We finally meet, Mr. Choi Kang.

00:04:24.953 --> 00:04:26.872
Did you set off the bombs
in our neighborhood?

00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:28.540
Bombs?

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:33.587
I thought the news said it was butane gas.

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:38.425
There was the bus explosion too, right?

00:04:39.092 --> 00:04:40.594
The Minister told me everything.

00:04:41.887 --> 00:04:43.805
It was your message
on the laptop too, wasn't it?

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:46.933
How did you know about me?

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:51.396
JDD.

00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:57.110
You think this is funny?

00:05:02.032 --> 00:05:04.701
I'm only keeping you alive
because I've got questions for you.

00:05:04.784 --> 00:05:06.411
So you'd better answer carefully.

00:05:07.913 --> 00:05:10.790
CIA's information network and my wealth.

00:05:12.626 --> 00:05:14.169
Does that answer your question?

00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:16.087
Why did you approach Do-yeon?

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.340
She's a lot like Charlotte.

00:05:19.215 --> 00:05:20.592
Charlotte...

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:23.678
also loved bunnies.

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:25.639
All of this because of Charlotte?

00:05:25.722 --> 00:05:27.307
What would you have done in my place?

00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:29.726
Innocent people died because of you.

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:30.644
What about my daughter?

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:32.604
Why did she have to die?

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.109
Anyway,

00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:42.113
thanks for helping me
get rid of the Minister.

00:05:42.864 --> 00:05:43.907
Get rid of him?

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:46.076
What do you mean?

00:05:47.035 --> 00:05:50.455
It's none of your business,
so just forget about it.

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.584
I won't let you off with a warning
if you meddle with my plans again.

00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:56.127
Think of your daughter.

00:06:26.074 --> 00:06:28.243
- Let's just grab one more drink.
- No.

00:06:28.326 --> 00:06:30.036
I drank too much today.

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:34.624
Are you crazy? Call a chauffeur!

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:37.043
There he goes again,
knowing his daddy will save him.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.420
I'm fine.

00:06:39.212 --> 00:06:40.296
I'm not drunk at all.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.132
You crazy bastard.

00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:44.467
You'd better not drive!

00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:11.494
Na Eun-jae speaking.

00:07:13.997 --> 00:07:15.123
Hello?

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.335
A person killed someone
while driving drunk.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.672
Another person manipulated a court ruling.

00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:25.592
What should be done about such people?

00:07:28.053 --> 00:07:29.012
Sullivan?

00:07:30.972 --> 00:07:32.640
They should pay
for what they've done, right?

00:07:34.225 --> 00:07:35.685
What are you trying to pull here?

00:07:51.367 --> 00:07:52.368
Hello?

00:08:18.478 --> 00:08:20.480
What the hell is this guy saying?

00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:44.045
Mr. Kwon, it's Eun-jae.

00:08:44.129 --> 00:08:44.963
Hey.

00:08:45.547 --> 00:08:46.756
Is everything okay with you?

00:08:47.298 --> 00:08:49.676
Yes, why do you ask?

00:08:50.218 --> 00:08:51.052
It's nothing.

00:08:51.636 --> 00:08:53.471
Let's get dinner together sometime.

00:08:53.555 --> 00:08:56.182
Sir, U-seong got into a car accident.

00:08:56.266 --> 00:08:57.433
He's in a critical condition.

00:08:57.517 --> 00:08:59.602
What did you just say?

00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:00.687
Mr. Kwon?

00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:02.772
What's going on?

00:09:10.446 --> 00:09:12.073
They should pay
for what they've done, right?

00:09:20.707 --> 00:09:25.461
THE LEGENDARY DROPKICK

00:09:31.342 --> 00:09:32.719
Did you hear?

00:09:32.802 --> 00:09:35.430
The son of the National Assembly Speaker
died in a car accident last night.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:36.973
You reap what you sow.

00:09:37.849 --> 00:09:40.310
Hey, a person died here.

00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:42.604
He also ran someone over to death.

00:09:42.687 --> 00:09:45.148
The daughter of the famous James Sullivan.

00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:47.609
Rumor has it
that he was also drunk that time.

00:09:48.318 --> 00:09:50.361
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:09:50.904 --> 00:09:54.324
The excuse was that he was on duty
on the day of his discharge,

00:09:54.407 --> 00:09:56.659
and the court just let him go
after ruling him innocent.

00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:59.746
Nobody's ever on duty
on the day of their discharge. Ridiculous.

00:10:00.163 --> 00:10:01.039
Never.

00:10:02.373 --> 00:10:05.084
But you wouldn't know that, would you?
You didn't serve.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.298
Hey, I know that much.

00:10:10.715 --> 00:10:11.549
Anyway,

00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:15.929
he only got out of that
because of his dad.

00:10:16.012 --> 00:10:18.806
Military law is actually much stricter.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.643
There's the brig
and even the disciplinary training.

00:10:23.186 --> 00:10:24.646
You know what brigs are?

00:10:27.232 --> 00:10:29.901
Come on. Of course I do.

00:10:29.984 --> 00:10:31.527
Bricks are what you build houses with.

00:10:33.154 --> 00:10:35.114
Just keep eating.

00:10:37.784 --> 00:10:39.786
Now that I think about it,

00:10:40.536 --> 00:10:42.038
I feel so bad for James Sullivan.

00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:42.956
Me too.

00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:45.959
You can get out of anything in Korea
if you've got connections.

00:10:46.042 --> 00:10:48.294
Even in court.

00:10:48.836 --> 00:10:50.421
That's why I quit being a lawyer.

00:10:50.713 --> 00:10:52.423
I couldn't stand it.

00:11:01.474 --> 00:11:02.600
Excuse me.

00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:04.018
Where are you going?

00:11:04.102 --> 00:11:05.144
To the bathroom.

00:11:05.228 --> 00:11:07.689
He's going to the bathroom
in the middle of a meal? Gross.

00:11:23.997 --> 00:11:25.039
Did you find anything?

00:11:25.498 --> 00:11:28.167
Sullivan bought all the arms

00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:30.295
that the Minister snuck away
to the Middle East.

00:11:30.503 --> 00:11:32.714
And all of that has returned to Korea?

00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:34.882
We're not sure of how many.

00:11:37.176 --> 00:11:38.469
What about Novus?

00:11:38.553 --> 00:11:40.096
I met Sullivan there last night.

00:11:40.388 --> 00:11:41.514
I know.

00:11:42.223 --> 00:11:44.475
But the warehouse is empty now,

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:46.394
and we can't locate Sullivan, either.

00:11:46.477 --> 00:11:47.770
What about the people around him?

00:11:54.902 --> 00:11:57.280
A few days ago, he was photographed

00:11:57.363 --> 00:11:59.782
with a member of the assembly
at a hotel lobby.

00:12:00.283 --> 00:12:01.701
Kiyun-si's representative,

00:12:02.535 --> 00:12:03.411
Na Eun-jae.

00:12:03.786 --> 00:12:04.746
Na Eun-jae?

00:12:06.122 --> 00:12:07.707
Are you saying

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.959
she has something to do with Sullivan?

00:12:10.418 --> 00:12:14.839
Ms. Na seems to have helped
the son of the Speaker get an acquittal.

00:12:15.256 --> 00:12:16.924
Both she and the Minister

00:12:17.008 --> 00:12:19.844
purchased land in Kiyun-si
under borrowed names.

00:12:19.927 --> 00:12:23.723
And the Speaker got Kiyun-si appointed
for the specialized IT zone.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.226
So it's a personal vendetta.

00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:29.604
I think so too.

00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:34.275
Na Eun-jae must be next, then.

00:12:36.778 --> 00:12:39.864
SAFE GAS STATION

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:44.202
Hello!

00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:46.454
Did you see the news about Kim Seok-jun?

00:12:47.622 --> 00:12:49.332
Where's Producer Kim?

00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:52.001
Oh, right. He's somewhere else now.

00:12:53.044 --> 00:12:55.421
It feels so empty here without him.

00:12:55.505 --> 00:12:57.548
You can see him once the case is over.

00:12:57.673 --> 00:12:59.300
I know that.

00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:01.844
Who caused the bomb explosions, though?

00:13:01.928 --> 00:13:03.179
The news didn't cover that.

00:13:04.013 --> 00:13:05.515
Did you hear anything about it?

00:13:06.432 --> 00:13:08.768
No, it's still under investigation.

00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:14.982
Could you please tell me
if Mr. Lee tells you anything, Su-jin?

00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:20.321
Come on. You have to tell me.

00:13:20.405 --> 00:13:21.614
You promise?

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.077
Ms. Lee, did you see the news?

00:13:28.538 --> 00:13:30.123
Hey, Yong-hui.

00:13:30.706 --> 00:13:34.043
Man, why does he keep getting in my way?

00:13:34.293 --> 00:13:35.711
Promise me. Come on.

00:13:41.968 --> 00:13:43.428
Fine, I'll let you know.

00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:45.555
Really? You promised, okay?

00:13:45.638 --> 00:13:46.764
Where's your pinky?

00:13:46.848 --> 00:13:48.516
You'll tell me first, okay?

00:13:48.599 --> 00:13:50.685
My pinky will be waiting here
until you tell me!

00:13:52.019 --> 00:13:53.354
What do you think you're doing?

00:13:53.438 --> 00:13:54.313
What?

00:13:54.439 --> 00:13:57.567
What did you two just promise?

00:14:00.445 --> 00:14:02.071
About new updates?

00:14:02.155 --> 00:14:03.322
What? Updates?

00:14:03.614 --> 00:14:04.824
It's nothing.

00:14:04.907 --> 00:14:05.867
Updates?

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.494
What update?
Everyone should be kept in the loop.

00:14:08.578 --> 00:14:10.329
You can't pinky-promise things
between you two.

00:14:10.413 --> 00:14:12.373
- You promised, Su-jin!
- Come here.

00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:19.589
Hey, Min-seo. How did your midterms go?

00:14:19.672 --> 00:14:21.382
You should've gone home. Why are you here?

00:14:21.466 --> 00:14:23.176
I have something to tell Mom.

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:25.094
Mom isn't here.

00:14:25.178 --> 00:14:26.012
Hold on.

00:14:29.265 --> 00:14:31.767
You, this, end?

00:14:32.226 --> 00:14:33.603
I understand Korean.

00:14:34.479 --> 00:14:35.938
You're so fluent in Korean.

00:14:36.022 --> 00:14:37.148
Is this all?

00:14:37.231 --> 00:14:40.234
No, I'll also get a pack
of ten-liter garbage bags.

00:14:46.199 --> 00:14:48.284
That'll be 7,800 won. Points card?

00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:49.243
Hold on.

00:14:54.248 --> 00:14:56.626
Lee Sun-cheol. Number 1405.

00:14:56.709 --> 00:14:58.085
Lee Sun-cheol, 1405...

00:14:59.795 --> 00:15:00.963
Are you him?

00:15:01.047 --> 00:15:02.507
No, he's my boss.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.841
It's my manager's name.

00:15:04.884 --> 00:15:07.261
You're sharing points with your manager?

00:15:07.345 --> 00:15:09.180
Yes. He told me to.

00:15:10.848 --> 00:15:13.476
It's against the rules,
but I'll let you off the hook this time.

00:15:13.893 --> 00:15:15.645
Oh, okay, thank you.

00:15:17.647 --> 00:15:18.564
All right.

00:15:18.648 --> 00:15:20.233
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:24.946
Why are you being so petty over points?

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:27.823
Hey, 1,000 points are worth 1,000 won.

00:15:27.907 --> 00:15:29.534
All of that's money.

00:15:29.784 --> 00:15:30.952
I'm just trying to work hard--

00:15:31.035 --> 00:15:32.119
Excuse me.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.413
- What is it?
- I should get 2,200 won in change,

00:15:34.497 --> 00:15:35.831
but you gave me 3,200 won.

00:15:35.915 --> 00:15:37.124
You gave me 1,000 won extra.

00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:38.084
Have a good day.

00:15:39.585 --> 00:15:41.504
Wow, how embarrassing.

00:15:42.588 --> 00:15:43.756
Where's Mom, by the way?

00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:46.592
Don't bother Mom for a while, okay?

00:15:46.676 --> 00:15:48.719
She's dealing with some important stuff.

00:15:48.803 --> 00:15:49.637
Whatever.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.806
I got over 80 on my exams,
so she owes me shoes.

00:15:52.348 --> 00:15:54.308
You got over 80? Really?

00:15:55.893 --> 00:15:56.936
Oh, my.

00:15:58.229 --> 00:15:59.146
Where's my phone?

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.440
This is unbelievable. That can't be right.

00:16:03.568 --> 00:16:04.402
Here.

00:16:05.152 --> 00:16:07.405
Stop throwing this around.

00:16:07.488 --> 00:16:10.032
That's why the handle keeps falling off.

00:16:10.408 --> 00:16:13.327
That's too much nagging
for just fixing my knife.

00:16:13.953 --> 00:16:17.623
Everything about you is annoying,
but your nagging's the worst.

00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:20.710
Next time, ask Su-il to do it.

00:16:20.793 --> 00:16:22.587
What a nuisance.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.965
Everyone knows
that Su-il is bad with his hands.

00:16:26.048 --> 00:16:28.843
But how many times
do I have to fix these for you?

00:16:30.303 --> 00:16:31.345
Hey, Min-seo.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.764
Over 80?

00:16:34.724 --> 00:16:35.850
Really?

00:16:36.642 --> 00:16:37.685
Yes.

00:16:37.768 --> 00:16:39.061
No, I'll be right over.

00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:41.022
Okay, I got it.

00:16:41.606 --> 00:16:42.773
Hey, I'm off.

00:16:46.485 --> 00:16:48.654
She's making it sound like
80 is the perfect score.

00:16:56.912 --> 00:16:58.789
What's wrong, Ms. Jung?

00:17:00.499 --> 00:17:03.461
Min-seo got 80 in Math!

00:17:05.796 --> 00:17:08.758
Okay, but that's no reason
to run with a knife like that.

00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:10.343
Oh, this?

00:17:10.426 --> 00:17:13.471
I was just getting the handle fixed.

00:17:13.721 --> 00:17:15.348
Are you heading home from work?

00:17:15.848 --> 00:17:19.393
No, I was actually on my way to see you.

00:17:19.477 --> 00:17:21.479
I heard you were at the hardware store.

00:17:21.562 --> 00:17:22.647
Oh, me?

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.273
Do you need something?

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:27.652
Are you close with the assemblywoman,
Na Eun-jae?

00:17:29.403 --> 00:17:30.905
We went to high school together.

00:17:31.197 --> 00:17:32.615
Do you know her phone number?

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.492
I do,

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.745
but she didn't pick up when I called
to ask about Producer Kim before.

00:17:38.162 --> 00:17:39.914
The way she ignores her locals,

00:17:39.997 --> 00:17:42.041
she doesn't deserve to be
in the National Assembly.

00:17:43.876 --> 00:17:45.252
Why do you need her number?

00:17:46.045 --> 00:17:47.254
I need to ask her something.

00:17:56.097 --> 00:17:58.182
Hey, what do you need?

00:17:58.432 --> 00:17:59.350
I need a piggy bank.

00:17:59.433 --> 00:18:01.227
- Piggy bank? For Do-yeon?
- Yeah.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.603
- Shaped like a bunny?
- Yeah.

00:18:02.687 --> 00:18:03.604
Over there.

00:18:05.106 --> 00:18:09.193
Hey, the guys are gathering tonight.
You should join us.

00:18:09.527 --> 00:18:12.113
It's the heroes' night tonight.

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:14.365
I'll extend a special invitation to you.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.283
I can't tonight.

00:18:16.367 --> 00:18:17.368
Why not?

00:18:17.451 --> 00:18:18.661
Where are you going alone this time?

00:18:20.496 --> 00:18:21.747
Come on, now.

00:18:22.707 --> 00:18:25.584
You seemed stressed
when you left the bunker last night.

00:18:25.668 --> 00:18:26.711
Where did you go?

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.088
To meet Kim Seok-jun.

00:18:30.506 --> 00:18:31.882
Are you kidding me?

00:18:32.466 --> 00:18:34.927
You think you're all that, do you?

00:18:37.304 --> 00:18:38.681
Give me a heads up next time.

00:18:40.349 --> 00:18:41.183
And if I do?

00:18:42.101 --> 00:18:43.102
I'd go with you.

00:18:44.478 --> 00:18:45.980
And what would you do?

00:18:46.439 --> 00:18:47.857
Swoop in like a real hero.

00:18:51.402 --> 00:18:52.737
What?

00:18:53.112 --> 00:18:57.032
Do you think you're the main dish
while the rest of us are sides?

00:18:57.116 --> 00:19:01.495
You know, a main dish can only shine
when the sides do the work.

00:19:02.288 --> 00:19:03.539
You know nothing, do you?

00:19:03.622 --> 00:19:04.540
Here.

00:19:05.708 --> 00:19:06.584
Bye.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.214
What's with him?

00:19:14.216 --> 00:19:15.926
OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MEMBER
NA EUN-JAE

00:19:21.557 --> 00:19:23.559
I'm Choi Kang, a Changri-dong resident.

00:19:23.642 --> 00:19:25.102
Can we meet?

00:19:25.394 --> 00:19:27.480
It seems like you're next.

00:19:29.356 --> 00:19:31.192
You abducted a journalist?

00:19:31.567 --> 00:19:34.612
Don't put it like that. That's scary.

00:19:34.695 --> 00:19:36.906
I just took him in for a few questions.

00:19:36.989 --> 00:19:39.575
He was getting too deep
in the bomb investigations.

00:19:40.701 --> 00:19:42.661
You abducted a journalist
in this day and age?

00:19:42.745 --> 00:19:43.954
Are you insane?

00:19:44.038 --> 00:19:45.623
Stop saying it like that.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.129
The real issue is that his neighbor
somehow took him back.

00:19:52.922 --> 00:19:53.756
Who did?

00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:00.971
This guy.

00:20:02.389 --> 00:20:04.475
He seems like a nobody on paper,

00:20:04.558 --> 00:20:05.851
but something smells fishy.

00:20:06.352 --> 00:20:07.728
There's something to him.

00:20:20.074 --> 00:20:22.576
WHERE SHOULD WE MEET?

00:20:33.212 --> 00:20:34.338
Mr. Choi Kang?

00:20:34.421 --> 00:20:35.840
Yes, that's me.

00:20:38.217 --> 00:20:39.093
Did you come alone?

00:20:39.802 --> 00:20:41.011
Yes, and you?

00:20:41.428 --> 00:20:42.555
Me too.

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:48.352
What do you mean, I'm next?

00:20:49.812 --> 00:20:52.231
Kim Seok-jun has been arrested,
and Kwon U-seong is dead.

00:20:53.148 --> 00:20:55.025
It's your turn now.

00:20:56.026 --> 00:20:59.238
How can I believe
that you're not on the same side

00:20:59.947 --> 00:21:01.198
as Sullivan?

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.659
I don't think you have time for this.

00:21:05.536 --> 00:21:06.871
Good point.

00:21:07.746 --> 00:21:09.999
I'm getting blackmailed.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.960
How so?

00:21:14.295 --> 00:21:15.838
He says he'll blow everything up.

00:21:16.213 --> 00:21:18.966
Seems like Sullivan
will do something to this neighborhood.

00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:23.596
Can you get in touch with him?

00:21:30.519 --> 00:21:33.230
- This number does not exist.
- Oh, my.

00:21:33.314 --> 00:21:35.691
- Please check it again and re-dial.
- But I'm sure

00:21:35.774 --> 00:21:37.568
he called me with this number.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.243
Ms. Na, you came here alone, right?

00:21:46.327 --> 00:21:47.453
Yes, I told you.

00:21:48.954 --> 00:21:49.997
Let's walk.

00:22:28.619 --> 00:22:31.038
Oh, my goodness!

00:22:46.553 --> 00:22:48.472
Is this the police? Please hurry.

00:22:49.014 --> 00:22:50.474
We're getting attacked!

00:22:50.557 --> 00:22:52.267
He has a knife.

00:24:27.696 --> 00:24:28.906
This is Lee Geun-cheol.

00:24:29.823 --> 00:24:33.410
Please look into Sullivan
and anyone around him.

00:24:45.464 --> 00:24:46.715
Did you hear?

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:49.593
The son of the National Assembly Speaker
died in a car accident last night.

00:24:50.719 --> 00:24:51.887
You reap what you sow.

00:24:53.013 --> 00:24:54.556
I won't let you off with a warning

00:24:55.516 --> 00:24:57.392
if you meddle with my plans again.

00:24:57.935 --> 00:24:59.353
Think of your daughter.

00:24:59.645 --> 00:25:01.105
He says he'll blow everything up.

00:25:01.188 --> 00:25:03.690
Seems like Sullivan
will do something to this neighborhood.

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:22.417
KIYUN DREAM KINDERGARTEN

00:25:23.502 --> 00:25:25.129
- Do-yeon.
- Yeah?

00:25:25.212 --> 00:25:28.006
Tell me if you see anything odd
in the neighborhood, okay?

00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:29.383
Okay, Dad.

00:25:31.301 --> 00:25:32.427
But...

00:25:32.803 --> 00:25:34.221
what do you mean by odd?

00:25:35.347 --> 00:25:38.350
It's when a stranger
offers to buy you something.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.019
Or if you see a strange object
in front of our house.

00:25:41.103 --> 00:25:43.689
Or if anything suddenly disappears
or something appears out of nowhere.

00:25:43.772 --> 00:25:44.606
Okay?

00:25:44.857 --> 00:25:45.691
Okay!

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.151
Don't worry.

00:25:49.194 --> 00:25:50.195
Have a good day.

00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:51.572
Okay, Daddy.

00:25:53.365 --> 00:25:54.449
See you later!

00:25:54.533 --> 00:25:55.868
- Okay.
- Bye.

00:26:09.631 --> 00:26:12.551
The clay sculpture we made before is dry.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.016
Let's color it now.

00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:21.143
Can I have blue?

00:26:21.226 --> 00:26:23.187
- Which color?
- Blue, please.

00:26:37.367 --> 00:26:39.870
You must be tired
with all these deliveries.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.706
It's great to see our shop doing so well.

00:26:43.582 --> 00:26:44.875
CHRONOS QUANTUM LABORATORY

00:26:45.792 --> 00:26:48.629
I'll make a lot of money,
and let you live like a queen.

00:26:52.257 --> 00:26:53.800
My gosh, what's with you?

00:26:53.884 --> 00:26:54.843
Just go.

00:26:54.927 --> 00:26:56.178
- See you!
- Okay.

00:26:56.845 --> 00:26:58.138
Drive safely.

00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:04.561
You two are still so in love.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:05.938
That's cute.

00:27:06.813 --> 00:27:09.566
I didn't ask for your opinion.
Mind your own business.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.985
People might think
we're friends or something.

00:27:13.362 --> 00:27:15.113
You heard from Mr. Choi, right?

00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:18.200
I almost died last night.

00:27:21.745 --> 00:27:22.579
What?

00:27:22.871 --> 00:27:25.040
Didn't Mr. Choi tell you?

00:27:25.791 --> 00:27:30.087
Aren't you guys
the Power Rangers of Changri-dong?

00:27:31.672 --> 00:27:35.550
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.513
Who attacked them?

00:27:39.596 --> 00:27:41.765
They don't know who attacked them.

00:27:42.683 --> 00:27:44.851
He just ran off
when he heard the police coming.

00:27:46.603 --> 00:27:49.731
Mr. Choi asked me
for Eun-jae's number yesterday.

00:27:50.649 --> 00:27:51.775
You didn't know about this?

00:27:51.858 --> 00:27:53.777
No, he didn't tell me anything.

00:27:54.486 --> 00:27:56.321
I thought you two were best friends.

00:27:56.405 --> 00:27:57.489
You know nothing.

00:27:57.572 --> 00:27:59.116
That doesn't mean I know everything.

00:28:00.784 --> 00:28:02.494
So what did he talk about with her?

00:28:02.577 --> 00:28:04.788
I came to ask you about that.

00:28:04.871 --> 00:28:07.791
She said it was nothing important,
but how can I believe her?

00:28:12.337 --> 00:28:15.507
What the heck is he doing on his own?

00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:25.767
- Hello.
- What?

00:28:25.851 --> 00:28:28.061
Oh, you work here?

00:28:32.691 --> 00:28:34.026
"Ali."

00:28:34.484 --> 00:28:35.402
You're a researcher?

00:28:35.986 --> 00:28:36.903
Yes.

00:28:36.987 --> 00:28:39.448
Don't you have to study a lot
to become one?

00:28:39.531 --> 00:28:40.365
Of course.

00:28:40.449 --> 00:28:42.617
I graduated from a university in Pakistan

00:28:42.701 --> 00:28:44.661
and even studied in England.

00:28:44.745 --> 00:28:45.746
I studied quite a bit.

00:28:45.829 --> 00:28:48.165
That's so impressive.

00:28:48.832 --> 00:28:50.375
Pakistan...

00:28:50.459 --> 00:28:52.878
Wasn't the guy
who recently died in the ATM explosion

00:28:52.961 --> 00:28:55.088
also from Pakistan?

00:28:55.589 --> 00:28:59.301
He was my friend, Rashid.

00:29:00.761 --> 00:29:03.722
Oh, no. He was so far away from home.

00:29:05.098 --> 00:29:06.808
Why did you order so much?

00:29:06.892 --> 00:29:09.978
Oh, because I've been pulling
a lot of all-nighters lately.

00:29:10.062 --> 00:29:11.063
Thank you.

00:29:12.522 --> 00:29:14.066
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

00:29:14.441 --> 00:29:15.901
- I got it.
- Good.

00:29:16.902 --> 00:29:18.153
Stay strong, all right?

00:29:18.236 --> 00:29:20.530
- Let me know if you need any help.
- Thanks.

00:29:20.947 --> 00:29:22.783
- Thank you.
- Hold them properly.

00:29:22.866 --> 00:29:24.409
- Have a good day!
- You too.

00:29:33.418 --> 00:29:34.252
Yeah.

00:29:34.878 --> 00:29:39.424
The Investigation Unit
confirmed there was nothing odd.

00:29:39.508 --> 00:29:41.134
Yes. Right.

00:29:41.426 --> 00:29:44.054
We just have to pay that amount
and close the case.

00:29:44.429 --> 00:29:45.389
The final amount.

00:29:47.974 --> 00:29:49.601
SAFE GAS STATION

00:29:50.977 --> 00:29:52.687
- Hello?
- Are you busy?

00:29:52.979 --> 00:29:53.814
No.

00:29:55.982 --> 00:29:57.109
I'll be right over.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.822
I'm heading out for a meeting.

00:30:05.283 --> 00:30:07.744
KWAK BYEONG-NAM

00:30:08.703 --> 00:30:10.163
I'm busy. Let's talk later.

00:30:17.212 --> 00:30:18.755
What are you,
the busiest person in the world?

00:30:29.266 --> 00:30:30.183
Yes.

00:30:30.267 --> 00:30:31.977
The Vice Minister is in a meeting,

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.728
so he asked me to give you these.

00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:45.782
"Adopted to the United States
through an adoption facility in Kiyun-si"?

00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:48.243
We're also looking into
the Joinus Company guards,

00:30:48.326 --> 00:30:50.245
Rashid, the ATM explosion victim,

00:30:50.328 --> 00:30:52.414
as well as other people working for him.

00:31:12.642 --> 00:31:13.727
Who's this guy?

00:31:16.855 --> 00:31:18.690
Noah, born in Korea.

00:31:18.773 --> 00:31:20.775
He was adopted by Americans
when he was two.

00:31:20.984 --> 00:31:23.195
He served in DEVGRU,
the US Navy’s special operations unit.

00:31:23.278 --> 00:31:26.323
After that, he worked
for a Russian private military company

00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:29.451
and joined Sullivan's guard team
three years ago.

00:31:30.702 --> 00:31:32.287
Please look into the other members.

00:31:32.662 --> 00:31:33.497
Okay.

00:31:47.177 --> 00:31:48.553
That's Kang's car.

00:31:48.845 --> 00:31:50.472
Should I go and say hi?

00:31:51.014 --> 00:31:53.183
I'm totally not here to see Ms. Lee.

00:31:59.606 --> 00:32:01.441
- Kang.
- Hey.

00:32:02.692 --> 00:32:04.778
Oh, isn't that James Sullivan?

00:32:07.572 --> 00:32:10.367
Please take care of what I asked.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:11.409
Okay.

00:32:11.785 --> 00:32:13.036
- Yong-hui.
- Yeah?

00:32:13.495 --> 00:32:14.913
- I'm heading out.
- Okay.

00:32:14.996 --> 00:32:16.915
- See you around.
- Okay, see you.

00:32:16.998 --> 00:32:18.208
Bye.

00:32:18.291 --> 00:32:20.585
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

00:32:26.841 --> 00:32:28.093
Did you need something?

00:32:28.802 --> 00:32:30.929
Oh, not really.

00:32:31.012 --> 00:32:34.599
I just saw Kang's car outside
and thought I'd check in.

00:32:35.016 --> 00:32:36.768
I'm not here to see you.

00:32:37.435 --> 00:32:41.022
Not that I didn't want to see you.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.899
I mean...

00:32:42.983 --> 00:32:45.944
So what were those photos about?

00:32:46.653 --> 00:32:47.612
Oh, right.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.115
Please tell Jeong-hwan this.

00:32:50.198 --> 00:32:52.701
We think Sullivan
is behind all the bomb explosions.

00:32:53.243 --> 00:32:54.703
James Sullivan?

00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:56.746
Sullivan set off the bombs?

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.290
Yeah, I think so.

00:32:58.373 --> 00:33:00.250
Ms. Lee told me to tell you.

00:33:01.918 --> 00:33:04.045
We should report him immediately, then.

00:33:04.129 --> 00:33:05.255
So many people died from this.

00:33:05.338 --> 00:33:06.339
No, wait.

00:33:06.423 --> 00:33:08.800
We're not completely sure yet.

00:33:09.259 --> 00:33:11.595
Is this why Mr. Choi went to see Eun-jae?

00:33:13.221 --> 00:33:14.639
Hey, what did Kang say?

00:33:14.723 --> 00:33:18.351
He grabbed some photos and files
and just left.

00:33:18.435 --> 00:33:20.061
Photos? What photos?

00:33:20.729 --> 00:33:24.316
There was Sullivan's and some others.

00:33:24.858 --> 00:33:27.402
Seriously, what is he up to by himself?

00:33:27.902 --> 00:33:28.903
There's...

00:33:29.946 --> 00:33:32.407
nothing I can do,
even if I know who killed Myeong-o.

00:33:34.284 --> 00:33:36.161
Sorry, it's almost time
for my tutoring session.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.664
I'll go with you.

00:33:39.914 --> 00:33:41.583
Look into what's going on, okay?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.793
How am I supposed to do that?

00:33:43.877 --> 00:33:48.048
You're close with Kang,
so ask him and tell us.

00:33:48.673 --> 00:33:50.300
Why don't you ask him yourself?

00:33:53.345 --> 00:33:54.929
Are you heading out?

00:33:55.013 --> 00:33:56.306
What does it look like I'm doing?

00:34:08.234 --> 00:34:11.029
I heard you met Myeong-o's mom
a couple days ago.

00:34:12.656 --> 00:34:14.157
Did she tell you?

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.493
She boasted about
how you bought her Korean beef.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.039
She's barely been eating.

00:34:22.248 --> 00:34:24.459
She's so ridiculous.

00:34:24.542 --> 00:34:27.253
She said no when I called her out
for some pork belly.

00:34:27.671 --> 00:34:29.214
She's discriminating against me.

00:34:29.422 --> 00:34:30.965
Oh, actually...

00:34:31.049 --> 00:34:32.425
She's discriminating against pork belly.

00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:34.761
You offered her Korean beef.

00:34:36.846 --> 00:34:37.931
You think so?

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.149
Who's this from?

00:34:48.233 --> 00:34:49.150
I'm not sure.

00:34:49.901 --> 00:34:52.028
Please sign here.

00:34:52.112 --> 00:34:52.987
Okay.

00:34:56.491 --> 00:34:58.284
- Thank you.
- Yes, good night.

00:35:26.688 --> 00:35:30.734
Since you're not making any moves,
I've decided on a time.

00:35:33.486 --> 00:35:34.904
Time for what?

00:35:36.197 --> 00:35:39.451
Hold a live press conference
within the next 12 hours.

00:35:40.535 --> 00:35:44.748
Confess everything you've done
at the press conference.

00:35:44.831 --> 00:35:45.915
Are you kidding me?

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:47.584
Who do you think--

00:35:47.667 --> 00:35:49.544
You must not be too late,

00:35:49.794 --> 00:35:51.588
and you may not report this to the police.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.425
And what if I do?

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.206
You should've gone to the police,
not come to me.

00:36:26.289 --> 00:36:27.916
He said the bomb will go off if I do.

00:36:28.792 --> 00:36:30.251
Did he tell you where the bomb was?

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.212
No, nothing about that.

00:36:51.981 --> 00:36:54.442
You're making things complicated,
Mr. Choi.

00:36:56.694 --> 00:36:57.862
Is he watching us?

00:36:59.239 --> 00:37:00.406
Where's the bomb?

00:37:01.115 --> 00:37:02.492
I warned you

00:37:03.076 --> 00:37:04.410
not to meddle with my plan.

00:37:04.702 --> 00:37:06.746
Where's the bomb, you crazy bastard?

00:37:09.624 --> 00:37:10.708
Thanks to you,

00:37:11.543 --> 00:37:13.086
I'm shortening the timeline.

00:37:13.753 --> 00:37:14.587
What?

00:37:15.588 --> 00:37:18.883
There will be another bomb.

00:37:19.884 --> 00:37:21.135
Good luck finding it.

00:37:31.312 --> 00:37:33.731
This number does not exist.

00:37:35.859 --> 00:37:36.860
What do we do now?

00:37:36.943 --> 00:37:38.528
Did he say anything else?

00:37:38.945 --> 00:37:40.488
Nothing much.

00:37:40.572 --> 00:37:42.949
He just told me to hold a press conference
within the next 12 hours.

00:37:43.533 --> 00:37:44.742
What press conference?

00:37:46.327 --> 00:37:49.789
About the Minister helping U-seong
get away with no sentence or whatever.

00:37:50.999 --> 00:37:54.627
He wants me to expose
everything they've done.

00:37:57.046 --> 00:37:58.840
Why is he telling you to do that?

00:37:59.716 --> 00:38:01.092
How should I know?

00:38:26.034 --> 00:38:28.578
It's urgent. Let's meet right now.

00:38:28.661 --> 00:38:29.787
Come to the gym.

00:38:29.871 --> 00:38:31.039
I'm on my way now.

00:38:31.122 --> 00:38:33.082
Okay, Su-il's coming with me.

00:38:33.374 --> 00:38:34.876
That's new.

00:38:35.835 --> 00:38:37.503
He's suddenly looking for his side dishes.

00:38:44.218 --> 00:38:47.221
Hey! Another bomb?

00:38:47.305 --> 00:38:49.641
Where is it this time?

00:38:49.724 --> 00:38:51.476
I need to get on it.

00:38:51.559 --> 00:38:52.685
Where is it? I'll--

00:38:52.769 --> 00:38:54.646
Calm down.

00:38:56.522 --> 00:38:57.899
There seem to be two bombs.

00:38:58.816 --> 00:39:00.068
I don't know where they are.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.278
You acted all high and mighty,
but you know nothing.

00:39:02.987 --> 00:39:06.115
Shouldn't we go out
and look for the bombs, then?

00:39:06.199 --> 00:39:08.409
But we don't know where to search.

00:39:08.493 --> 00:39:10.703
We can't find them in ten hours
in an area this big.

00:39:10.787 --> 00:39:13.206
Then are you telling everyone
to just die, then?

00:39:14.332 --> 00:39:15.541
What's with you?

00:39:18.419 --> 00:39:19.504
Never mind.

00:39:20.213 --> 00:39:21.255
Keep talking.

00:39:23.633 --> 00:39:25.134
First,

00:39:25.218 --> 00:39:26.844
why don't we evacuate the residents?

00:39:26.928 --> 00:39:28.721
How do we evacuate all these people?

00:39:28.805 --> 00:39:30.974
And if we do, the bomber may notice.

00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:35.311
Why don't we make them stay inside
instead of evacuating them?

00:39:35.937 --> 00:39:37.146
And seek shelter at home?

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.649
Yes, since we don't know
where the bombs are,

00:39:39.774 --> 00:39:41.192
we'll keep the people inside.

00:39:41.275 --> 00:39:43.987
And we'll look for the bombs
while they stay in.

00:39:44.445 --> 00:39:46.572
That sounds like a good plan.

00:39:46.656 --> 00:39:49.826
If we make people panic,
it might cause bigger trouble.

00:39:50.243 --> 00:39:52.078
Let's do it!

00:39:52.161 --> 00:39:54.080
That's a great plan! Let's do it.

00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:56.290
Let's go!

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.167
Let's go...

00:39:59.502 --> 00:40:00.878
Let's start early tomorrow morning.

00:40:01.587 --> 00:40:03.965
Yong-hui and Jeong-hwan,
take care of the kindergarten and schools.

00:40:04.048 --> 00:40:04.966
Okay.

00:40:05.049 --> 00:40:07.635
You can tell all our customers
to stay home.

00:40:07.719 --> 00:40:08.803
Yeah!

00:40:11.097 --> 00:40:13.349
Byeong-nam will take the residential areas
with Chun-bae.

00:40:13.433 --> 00:40:15.101
- I'll go with Mr. Choi--
- Actually...

00:40:15.977 --> 00:40:17.270
I'll be on my own.

00:40:17.353 --> 00:40:18.855
I have somewhere to go.

00:40:21.315 --> 00:40:22.150
Sure.

00:40:22.984 --> 00:40:25.319
Then please do your best tomorrow morning.

00:40:25.403 --> 00:40:26.237
Good night.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.989
- Good night.
- Bye, Kang!

00:40:28.698 --> 00:40:29.824
Well, then...

00:40:35.121 --> 00:40:36.330
Hey, Kang.

00:40:37.498 --> 00:40:38.624
Kang!

00:40:46.257 --> 00:40:48.509
Why do you keep going off on your own?

00:40:48.801 --> 00:40:49.927
What do you mean?

00:40:50.011 --> 00:40:51.304
Even now.

00:40:52.138 --> 00:40:55.683
You knew it was Sullivan
who's been setting off the bombs.

00:40:58.061 --> 00:40:59.395
I heard from the Minister.

00:40:59.687 --> 00:41:01.105
Why didn't you tell us?

00:41:01.606 --> 00:41:03.191
You even met Na Eun-jae yesterday.

00:41:03.483 --> 00:41:05.234
Is she involved in this?

00:41:09.489 --> 00:41:10.323
I think so.

00:41:10.406 --> 00:41:12.075
Come on, I mean...

00:41:12.158 --> 00:41:13.785
This is about our neighborhood.

00:41:13.868 --> 00:41:15.703
Why won't you tell us anything?

00:41:18.331 --> 00:41:20.166
Sullivan's guys are pros.

00:41:21.125 --> 00:41:22.376
We're no match for them.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.128
- We might die.
- So?

00:41:24.212 --> 00:41:27.048
You'll leave your annoying neighbors
and solve this on your own?

00:41:27.131 --> 00:41:28.841
I'm a part of this neighborhood too!

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.886
I just...

00:41:32.762 --> 00:41:34.138
don't want to put you guys in danger--

00:41:34.222 --> 00:41:36.140
And what, are you immortal?

00:41:36.307 --> 00:41:37.975
Do you think you can
save everyone on your own?

00:41:38.267 --> 00:41:39.894
You're delusional.

00:41:47.026 --> 00:41:48.778
Forget it.
There's no point in talking to you.

00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:49.821
Hey...

00:41:53.741 --> 00:41:55.326
Damn it.

00:42:41.622 --> 00:42:44.083
OUTER LAYER -
BLAST PRESSURE DIFFUSION + HEAT RESISTANCE

00:42:44.167 --> 00:42:46.460
CARBON NANOTUBE FIBER

00:42:55.678 --> 00:42:56.929
Are you already heading out?

00:42:57.263 --> 00:42:58.097
Yeah.

00:43:01.017 --> 00:43:02.643
Daddy, I want water.

00:43:02.727 --> 00:43:03.644
Water?

00:43:07.899 --> 00:43:09.066
All right.

00:43:12.236 --> 00:43:13.487
Here you go.

00:43:16.741 --> 00:43:17.658
Do-yeon,

00:43:18.201 --> 00:43:19.660
you're not going to kindergarten today.

00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:21.495
You can't go.

00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:24.081
Why not? I have to go.

00:43:24.498 --> 00:43:25.750
What are you talking about?

00:43:29.045 --> 00:43:30.087
Do-yeon,

00:43:30.171 --> 00:43:32.215
let's just rest at home today, okay?

00:43:32.298 --> 00:43:36.260
No, I'm supposed to decorate Pinky today!

00:43:36.344 --> 00:43:38.346
I want to go!

00:43:39.889 --> 00:43:43.267
Why are you making her cry
first thing in the morning?

00:43:46.479 --> 00:43:47.772
You should stay in too.

00:43:47.855 --> 00:43:49.565
Why? What is it this time?

00:43:50.024 --> 00:43:52.568
- I'll tell you once I get back.
- Dad, I hate you.

00:43:52.652 --> 00:43:53.945
Make sure to stay in, okay?

00:43:58.783 --> 00:44:00.618
It's okay. Don't cry.

00:44:03.454 --> 00:44:04.789
- Hey.
- Where's Min-seo?

00:44:04.872 --> 00:44:06.582
I told her to stay home today,

00:44:06.666 --> 00:44:08.084
and she was like, "Sweet!"

00:44:08.626 --> 00:44:09.710
My goodness.

00:44:09.794 --> 00:44:12.213
How is she going to go to college
with that attitude?

00:44:13.172 --> 00:44:14.882
Have you contacted
the Women's Association?

00:44:14.966 --> 00:44:17.760
Yeah, but three people didn't pick up.
I'd better go to them.

00:44:18.678 --> 00:44:22.181
Make sure to tell all customers
to go home and stay inside.

00:44:22.265 --> 00:44:23.724
Okay, got it!

00:44:24.016 --> 00:44:25.643
- Tell them to go home!
- Yes, ma'am!

00:44:27.728 --> 00:44:29.605
HARDWARE STORE

00:44:38.864 --> 00:44:42.243
These are the spots
with the most foot traffic.

00:44:43.035 --> 00:44:44.954
It'll be different
from other terrorist attacks.

00:44:45.955 --> 00:44:50.626
He's going to choose spots
that would best deliver his message.

00:44:51.711 --> 00:44:54.297
I've narrowed
the possible spots down to these.

00:44:55.214 --> 00:44:57.425
Please send this data to me.

00:44:57.633 --> 00:44:58.634
Okay.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.846
But are you sure you'll be fine alone?

00:45:04.515 --> 00:45:05.725
I'm not alone.

00:45:11.856 --> 00:45:13.983
Dong-gwan, take it and eat it at home.

00:45:14.066 --> 00:45:15.568
- What?
- Go home!

00:45:19.322 --> 00:45:20.698
Hello!

00:45:20.948 --> 00:45:23.159
Everyone, I got these for you.

00:45:23.242 --> 00:45:26.829
Please enjoy,
but don't come out until lunchtime, okay?

00:45:27.204 --> 00:45:29.373
You promised! Until lunch!

00:45:46.307 --> 00:45:48.434
Kids, what are you doing here?

00:45:48.517 --> 00:45:49.810
Go back to school.

00:45:51.187 --> 00:45:52.855
Who the hell do you think you are?

00:45:53.272 --> 00:45:54.607
Just listen to me.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.025
Whatever.

00:45:56.317 --> 00:45:57.943
Piss off, all right?

00:45:58.569 --> 00:46:00.404
Hey, watch it.

00:46:00.488 --> 00:46:01.614
What the hell?

00:46:06.077 --> 00:46:07.870
Gosh, kids these days.

00:46:11.374 --> 00:46:12.541
Hey, mini car!

00:46:13.209 --> 00:46:14.293
Oh, Mr. Kwak!

00:46:14.668 --> 00:46:16.879
Are you smoking cigarettes right now?

00:46:17.088 --> 00:46:18.130
Hey, put them away.

00:46:19.507 --> 00:46:21.675
What are you doing here?
You should be at school.

00:46:25.429 --> 00:46:27.515
Did you mess with this guy?

00:46:27.598 --> 00:46:29.183
- Oh, no.
- No?

00:46:29.642 --> 00:46:32.686
Perfect. Listen to me carefully.

00:46:33.229 --> 00:46:35.147
Go back to your classrooms right now.

00:46:35.231 --> 00:46:38.359
And don't come out until lunch, okay?

00:46:38.609 --> 00:46:39.944
- Why?
- "Why?"

00:46:40.027 --> 00:46:41.153
Yes.

00:46:41.362 --> 00:46:42.863
You want me to call your mom?

00:46:42.947 --> 00:46:44.281
Fine!

00:46:44.448 --> 00:46:46.409
- Let's go.
- Good.

00:46:46.492 --> 00:46:47.410
Go.

00:46:47.493 --> 00:46:49.453
- Tell the kids in the other classes too.
- Go on.

00:46:50.079 --> 00:46:53.666
- Study hard, all right?
- And stop smoking.

00:46:53.749 --> 00:46:56.752
- I can't believe those kids.
- If I were any younger, I would've...

00:46:57.503 --> 00:46:58.712
- Hey.
- What?

00:46:58.796 --> 00:47:00.089
They didn't beat you up, did they?

00:47:00.172 --> 00:47:01.757
Of course not!

00:47:03.801 --> 00:47:04.927
Wait for me.

00:47:07.221 --> 00:47:08.472
We've covered the kindergarten,

00:47:08.556 --> 00:47:10.975
schools, health centers,
and the community service center.

00:47:11.058 --> 00:47:13.060
I went to the senior citizen center
and the library.

00:47:13.227 --> 00:47:15.729
Do you really think there are bombs?

00:47:15.855 --> 00:47:18.065
It's a huge problem if there are,

00:47:18.357 --> 00:47:20.985
but if they're not,
I still want to kill this Sullivan.

00:47:21.277 --> 00:47:22.611
We only have three more hours.

00:47:22.695 --> 00:47:25.322
I'd better check on the families
who haven't gotten back to me.

00:47:25.406 --> 00:47:27.074
- I'll get going first.
- Okay.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.746
Eun-jae will have a live interview
in three hours.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.081
Where?

00:47:34.457 --> 00:47:36.125
At the community service center
auditorium.

00:47:37.001 --> 00:47:38.878
This is just my opinion, but...

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.714
Wouldn't one of the bombs
be at the interview?

00:47:41.797 --> 00:47:43.757
COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER

00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:46.677
Because it's a live broadcast
with lots of people.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.471
- Exactly.
- That makes total sense.

00:47:48.554 --> 00:47:51.640
Why don't we search for the bombs,
then gather back at the center?

00:47:51.891 --> 00:47:54.310
- Let's do that.
- Sounds good.

00:48:02.818 --> 00:48:03.694
Mr. Oh.

00:48:03.944 --> 00:48:05.362
Hey, where are you going?

00:48:06.071 --> 00:48:09.158
I'll check the bus stop
and head to the press conference.

00:48:10.493 --> 00:48:12.953
Oh, no, we have less than an hour.

00:48:13.287 --> 00:48:14.413
No bombs found yet, huh?

00:48:15.206 --> 00:48:16.832
No, I'm still looking.

00:48:17.875 --> 00:48:20.377
Sullivan, this bastard.

00:48:21.003 --> 00:48:22.922
This is basically his hometown.

00:48:23.005 --> 00:48:25.549
Why is he causing all this trouble?

00:48:26.175 --> 00:48:27.301
Right.

00:48:36.268 --> 00:48:39.313
"Adopted to the United States
through an adoption facility in Kiyun-si"?

00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:46.487
Is there an adoption facility in Kiyun-si
that's quite old?

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.947
An adoption facility?

00:48:49.657 --> 00:48:51.450
The only place
that handled stuff like that

00:48:52.576 --> 00:48:54.286
was the Changri Church.

00:49:00.584 --> 00:49:01.919
PRESS CONFERENCE SCRIPT

00:49:03.003 --> 00:49:05.005
You called the press, right?

00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:08.801
Yes, I told them to come
to the Community Service Center

00:49:08.884 --> 00:49:09.802
by 11:50 p.m.

00:49:10.636 --> 00:49:11.679
Okay.

00:49:12.304 --> 00:49:15.641
You also contacted
the hospital and the fire station?

00:49:15.724 --> 00:49:17.393
Yes, they're on standby.

00:49:17.476 --> 00:49:18.727
They know not to say anything.

00:49:19.687 --> 00:49:20.563
Don't worry, ma'am.

00:49:24.149 --> 00:49:26.527
How could I not worry?

00:49:29.238 --> 00:49:34.368
All of this is because of that moron,
Kim Seok-jun.

00:49:37.121 --> 00:49:38.205
Sorry.

00:49:48.882 --> 00:49:50.092
- Hurry.
- Okay.

00:50:01.061 --> 00:50:03.522
It's not in any of the spots
that I could think of.

00:50:04.064 --> 00:50:05.691
Let's head to the press conference.

00:50:05.774 --> 00:50:07.318
We have 35 minutes now.

00:50:07.401 --> 00:50:09.111
Where did Kang go?

00:50:09.194 --> 00:50:11.655
Kang went to Changri Church.

00:50:12.239 --> 00:50:13.324
Changri Church?

00:50:19.079 --> 00:50:23.334
CHANGRI-DONG COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER

00:50:23.709 --> 00:50:25.210
You heard anything?

00:50:25.294 --> 00:50:27.546
- What is she trying to talk about?
- Let's head in.

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:28.756
- Come on.
- Let's go.

00:50:28.839 --> 00:50:30.382
Hello, again.

00:50:30.466 --> 00:50:33.427
AUDITORIUM HALL

00:50:48.025 --> 00:50:49.943
Stay on your best game, Eun-jae.

00:50:51.612 --> 00:50:54.657
With the way things are,

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.408
there's nothing to lose
even if the bombs go off.

00:50:58.035 --> 00:50:59.662
Let's become the politician

00:50:59.745 --> 00:51:02.164
who's fighting against
a terrorist for her nation.

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:20.367
JUSTICE IS NOT SILENT

00:52:22.286 --> 00:52:24.747
Dear distinguished locals,

00:52:25.205 --> 00:52:28.083
and all press joining me here today,

00:52:28.751 --> 00:52:31.003
I'm Na Eun-jae,
the representative of Kiyun-si.

00:52:37.009 --> 00:52:38.010
I'm standing here today

00:52:38.093 --> 00:52:42.055
after being blackmailed by a terrorist
who has been bombing Kiyun-si.

00:52:42.848 --> 00:52:44.600
- What?
- Is this true?

00:52:44.683 --> 00:52:46.602
- What is she saying?
- No way!

00:52:47.019 --> 00:52:48.353
A terrorist bombing?

00:52:48.479 --> 00:52:50.189
- Really?
- How can this be?

00:52:50.773 --> 00:52:54.943
I was told that if I didn't do
as he had commanded me,

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.992
he would make a bomb go off soon.

00:53:28.894 --> 00:53:33.524
But I will never negotiate with him

00:53:35.067 --> 00:53:37.110
or give in to his threats.

00:53:37.653 --> 00:53:38.987
Yong-hui.

00:53:39.071 --> 00:53:41.615
So Sullivan's goal
is to get rid of Ms. Na, right?

00:53:41.698 --> 00:53:44.243
- Yeah.
- Then where would he have put the bomb?

00:53:44.618 --> 00:53:46.703
Jeong-hwan, I don't like bombs.

00:53:46.787 --> 00:53:49.289
I mean, let's say you're Sullivan.

00:53:49.373 --> 00:53:51.750
If you were the terrorist,

00:53:51.834 --> 00:53:53.585
instead of hiding a bomb somewhere,

00:53:54.127 --> 00:53:56.046
wouldn't you just blow up that phone?

00:53:56.129 --> 00:53:57.297
No way.

00:54:15.691 --> 00:54:18.277
The cellphone is from Sullivan.

00:54:20.612 --> 00:54:23.198
Ms. Na, the phone is the bomb!

00:54:23.282 --> 00:54:24.116
What?

00:54:33.792 --> 00:54:34.835
Kang.

00:54:50.517 --> 00:54:51.685
Throw it!

00:54:52.895 --> 00:54:54.062
Stay back!

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:07.886
FOURTH EXPLOSION
ON SEPT 15, 2025 AT 12:00 P.M.

00:56:13.266 --> 00:56:17.854
YEAR 1982

00:56:29.241 --> 00:56:30.701
CHANGRI CHURCH

00:57:00.981 --> 00:57:02.107
Pastor!

00:57:02.774 --> 00:57:03.942
Pastor!

00:57:08.947 --> 00:57:10.532
Hurry! Over here!

00:57:13.452 --> 00:57:15.037
There's a baby here.

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.204
Oh, goodness.

00:57:21.752 --> 00:57:24.296
Oh, my. What a precious child.

00:57:24.504 --> 00:57:26.048
Come here.

00:57:26.757 --> 00:57:27.841
Oh, my.

00:57:28.425 --> 00:57:32.429
Who would abandon such a beautiful child?

00:57:37.184 --> 00:57:38.226
All right.

00:57:39.061 --> 00:57:40.270
You're okay, child.

00:57:42.147 --> 00:57:43.273
Chun-bae.

00:57:45.317 --> 00:57:47.861
Do you know why babies
have such beautiful smiles?

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.072
No, I don't.

00:57:50.614 --> 00:57:51.823
Babies can hear

00:57:52.574 --> 00:57:54.910
angels whispering to them.

00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:56.244
That's right.

00:58:11.051 --> 00:58:12.469
What did you pray for?

00:58:15.889 --> 00:58:20.936
Although he's been abandoned
and forgotten right now,

00:58:22.145 --> 00:58:24.523
I prayed for him to grow
strong and healthy

00:58:25.524 --> 00:58:28.026
and become someone everyone would know.

00:59:01.935 --> 00:59:06.314
CHANGRI CHURCH

01:00:12.464 --> 01:00:15.383
HEROES NEXT DOOR

01:00:15.467 --> 01:00:18.720
Since you're still alive, Ms. Na,
Sullivan's not done yet.

01:00:18.803 --> 01:00:22.557
If you hand that over,
we'll protect you from Sullivan.

01:00:23.433 --> 01:00:25.268
It's the anniversary of Charlotte's death
in three days.

01:00:25.352 --> 01:00:26.603
Something is going to happen.

01:00:26.686 --> 01:00:28.438
Stop looking for the bombs.

01:00:28.772 --> 01:00:30.148
Don't do a thing.

01:00:30.232 --> 01:00:32.817
What is it that you want?
Is this your revenge?

01:00:32.901 --> 01:00:35.195
I can't find Do-yeon.

01:00:35.278 --> 01:00:36.738
I can't find her anywhere.

01:00:36.821 --> 01:00:39.157
What do you mean Do-yeon's gone?

01:00:39.532 --> 01:00:41.743
I promise to bring Do-yeon back.

01:00:44.579 --> 01:00:46.581
