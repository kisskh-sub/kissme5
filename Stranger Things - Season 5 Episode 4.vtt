00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:17.434
Hey.

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.770
I know you're scared,
and I know you're angry,

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:24.273
but I promise you,
we are here to help you.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.817
Hey, Derek, Derek.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.278
If you keep doing that,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.782
Just calm down so we can talk, okay?

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:36.118
Do you know who I am?

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.829
An evil child kidnapper.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.874
Okay, I understand
why you would think that,

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.001
but I'm not evil.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.504
I'm just a mom, a regular mom.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.758
That's my son, Will.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.383
Zombie boy.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.302
You know why they call him that?

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.554
Because he died and came back to life.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.224
But what people don't know is
that when he went missing,

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:03.228
he was taken by a terrible, scary monster.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.565
And now, that scary monster is after you.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:10.277
Yeah, I know. Mr. Whatsit told me,
which is why you need to let me go.

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:13.822
No, no. Mr. Whatsit is not
who he says he is, okay?

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:17.201
He is lying to you.
All these monsters, they work for him.

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:20.704
That's why we took you here to this barn.
We thought this barn was safe,

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:21.789
but he's found us.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.583
So we have to move you again,
somewhere he can't find you.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:28.630
So if I untie you,
will you cooperate and come with us?

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.299
Please?

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:33.468
Okay, great.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:37.596
You're a very brave kid, Derek.
I want you to know that.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.099
Very--

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.566
- Let me go! Get off of me!
- Derek. Please!

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.527
- The door! Get the door!
- Help me!

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.278
Let me go! Get off me!

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.948
- Stay down!
- Get away!

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.826
Somebody help! I'm being kidnapped!

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:01.037
Get away from me! Let me go!

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.081
Mom, the rope! I need the rope!

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.626
- Let me go! Eat dirt!
- Ah!

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.171
Come try us, dipshit!

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:12.215
Shit!

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.686
Dude! She's not lying to you, okay?

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:29.189
Mr. Whatsit is a very bad guy.
He sent the monsters after you.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.816
Suck my fat one!

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.109
Jesus! What?

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.444
You just signed
your death warrant, dipshit!

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:36.405
You're a psycho, and you're going to jail!

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.991
- There is a monster coming!
- We're trying to help you.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.826
- La, la, la, la.
- Derek, please!

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.119
You gotta come down.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.205
I'm not listening. La, la, la, la.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:08.855
Stay back!

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:21.367
You want him,
you're gonna have to come through me!

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.229
Yeah, we got him! We got him!

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:09.331
It flipped! It's headed back towards us!

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.500
Come on. What are you doing, man?
We gotta turn around!

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.543
Wait. Gates are like
Peanut Butter Boppers, right?

00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:16.505
- What?
- The outside is, like, crunchy and tough.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:19.132
But bite down on it,
it gives way to a gooey, creamy core.

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:21.009
Dude, what the hell are you talking about?

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.637
I drive fast enough,
the beamer can punch a hole into the gate,

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.932
and then we can track the Demo
on its home turf in the Upside Down.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.059
- Follow it back home.
- We're losing the signal!

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.061
We won't be able to follow anything
if we crash!

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.771
We won't crash if it's like a Bopper!

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:33.773
It's almost gone!

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:37.610
Do it.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.824
- Oh my God! Oh my God!
- Jesus.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.827
- Oh my God! Oh my God!
- I got it! I got it!

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:47.619
Oh God, no!

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.538
- It's not gonna work.
- We're not gonna make it!

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.582
- It's not a Bopper. Stop!
- Slow down! Jesus Christ!

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:54.836
- Shit! Oh my God!
- Hang on!

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.554
We did it! Woo!

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:07.974
Signal?

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.101
- Strong!
- Oh my God!

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:13.896
We got you, son of a bitch! We got you!

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.456
Will!? Will!

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:35.167
I'm right here, Will.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.793
It's okay.

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:38.963
I got you. I got you.

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:43.801
I got you, sweetie.

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:50.367
{\an8}Uh, hockety-pockety?

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.743
Oh, yes, yes, that's right.

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:54.913
Hockety-pockety wockety wack
Odds and ends and bric-a-brac

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.832
- I'll be with you in just a minute, son.
- What?

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.334
Packing's almost done!

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:02.922
Shush!

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.425
Jelly!

00:07:12.056 --> 00:07:12.931
Alan Miller?

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.226
I'm sorry, what is this about?

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:17.854
It's your daughter, sir.

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:51.178
Our boy's taking us on a shortcut
through Roane Cemetery.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.805
- That's almost at the county line.
- Doesn't this thing get tired?

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:57.184
Unfortunately, it looks like the opposite.
I think he's speeding up.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.935
- What?
- I'm losing the signal.

00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:00.228
You've gotta be shitting me!

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:01.814
- Can you go faster?
- Let's see.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.819
Henderson, you've gotta talk to me.
What do you got?

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.030
- Henderson, what--
- I'm picking up interference.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.491
- How is that important?
- It means I can't hear the signal.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.159
- Listen harder.
- What do you mean?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.994
- You wanna put these on?
- I'm driving!

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.954
You do the driving. I do the navigating.

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:20.123
- What is that?
- I don't know.

00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:21.458
Steve, slow down.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.126
Is he ahead of us or not?

00:08:23.127 --> 00:08:25.712
- Steve!
- Steve, watch out!

00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:27.632
- Steve, watch out!
- Shit!

00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:36.557
Jonathan,
it's Mom. Answer me, please. Over.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.976
Jonathan, please answer.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:44.815
Jonathan, Nancy, Dustin, it's Joyce.
Please answer me.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:46.441
Hey.

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:47.693
Any luck?

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:52.697
Well, on the plus side,
I guess that means they made it through.

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.325
Do you wanna see where they're headed?

00:09:25.022 --> 00:09:26.314
What is it?

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:27.732
I don't know,

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:32.738
but I could feel it's important to him.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.907
To Mr... Whatsit?

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.534
His real name is Henry.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:38.577
AKA Vecna.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.744
AKA One.

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:41.371
That's too many names.

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:44.165
Why won't you just zip it
and listen, dipshit?

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:47.128
I had this feeling
he didn't want me there.

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.631
I wasn't supposed to see it.

00:09:51.632 --> 00:09:54.009
You've never been this close
to the hive mind before.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.887
I mean, that thing was, like, feet away.

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.933
Sometimes at The Squawk,
when a signal comes in too strong,

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.852
it overloads the whole system.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.479
I think that's what this was, an overload.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.982
You didn't just tap into the hive mind.

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:12.402
You jacked right in
to the goddamn control center.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:14.696
And Holly. Where was Holly?

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:17.657
Holly. Holly, she was...

00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:21.120
She was attached to this... this spire.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:26.667
And she became a part of it somehow,
like it was doing something to her.

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:29.795
And... And there were others.

00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:32.590
There were three others.

00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:37.844
I thought
Vecna was just coming for dipshit.

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:41.098
So did I. But I only knew about Derek
because he walked right past me.

00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:45.060
Serendipitous timing.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.937
- You hear that? Serendipitous.
- I don't know what that means.

00:10:47.938 --> 00:10:51.232
I'm really not loving
all of these extra spires.

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:54.861
I mean, night one, Vecna kidnaps Holly.
Night two, he takes three more.

00:10:54.862 --> 00:10:57.405
He's escalating. And he's coming for more.

00:10:57.406 --> 00:11:00.742
Eight more, if this is accurate,
which brings him to a total of 12.

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:03.995
What does he want with them? And why kids?

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:05.163
- And why 12?
- I don't know.

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:07.248
But we have to stop him
before he takes any more

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:10.251
and buy Dustin and the others time
to find this place, to find Holly.

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:14.047
If we can pinpoint his exact targets,
we could get them out of Hawkins.

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:15.382
And out of Vecna's reach.

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:16.758
Did you forget we're quarantined?

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:19.010
- That's not all.
- There's another problem.

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.721
On the way here,
we saw soldiers load Debbie Miller

00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:23.682
onto a bus with a bunch more kids.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.768
We followed them for two blocks more,
and they loaded more kids onto it.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.896
I don't think
they were taking them to school.

00:11:29.897 --> 00:11:32.024
Vecna's not the only one
that wants these kids.

00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:42.158
Eleven was at the Wheeler house
the same night Holly was taken.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:45.453
Twenty-four hours later,
we've got three more missing kids.

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:49.582
There's 73 children in Hawkins
between the age of nine and ten.

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:53.378
If the pattern holds,
our next target will be from this group.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:57.215
And you believe
Eleven has taken these kids?

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.466
For what purpose?

00:11:58.467 --> 00:12:02.011
Killing them, protecting them.
The reason doesn't matter.

00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:03.763
These children? Where are they now?

00:12:03.764 --> 00:12:07.225
Arriving at the MAC-Z any moment,
which is where I want you.

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.978
I should be looking for Lt. Akers.
I find Akers, I find--

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.105
You'll find a dead man.

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:14.942
Report to the MAC-Z, Colonel.
That's an order.

00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:23.242
Major General.

00:12:25.202 --> 00:12:28.246
With all due respect,
these kids are in danger.

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.541
To use them as bait seems...

00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:34.420
Seems what, Sergeant?

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:37.339
Reckless.

00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:43.471
It's only reckless
if you fail to protect them.

00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:47.516
Are you telling me
you can't protect them, Sergeant?

00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:49.059
No, ma'am.

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:52.563
Good.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.995
I'm sorry for scaring you.

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:13.417
I haven't seen anyone
in... a really long time, so...

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.545
I guess I got excited.

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:20.757
Good news is it doesn't look that deep.

00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.301
Not enough for stitches.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.221
I bet it stings though, huh?

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.558
You can talk to me, you know.

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:31.894
I won't bite.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.565
You do remember me, right?

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.484
I've been to your house.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:40.778
Like, a lot.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.616
You're Max, Max Mayfield.

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:49.035
You skateboard
and never take off your Walkman.

00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:51.204
- That's me.
- But--

00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:53.874
How am I in here
when I'm in a coma in Hawkins General?

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:58.087
That's a very reasonable question.

00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:02.383
We should get going.
It's not safe here. Come on.

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.051
Where are we going?

00:14:05.052 --> 00:14:05.969
My home.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.221
Well, I can't go far.
I came here to meet Henry.

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:10.098
- Do you know Henry?
- You could say that.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:13.977
He left me this note. See? And he told me
to meet him right here at the X.

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:15.728
I think he's in trouble with the monsters.

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:18.523
Henry is a lot of things, but in trouble
with the monsters is not one of them.

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.692
- But the note says--
- I know what the note says.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.902
How do you know he's not in trouble?
He said hurry!

00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:26.198
Holly, I know what the note says
because Henry didn't write it. I did.

00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:30.870
I don't... I don't understand.

00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:33.163
I'm sorry.

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:38.669
I didn't want to lie. I... I just...
I had to make sure that you came here.

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:41.297
You're one of them, aren't you?

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.339
- One of what?
- The monsters.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.301
- Do I look like a monster?
- I don't know. Maybe you're in disguise.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.511
You're dressed weird,
and you're in a coma.

00:14:48.512 --> 00:14:49.763
Okay.

00:14:50.472 --> 00:14:53.766
Well, would a monster know
that your brother tried to get a mohawk

00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:55.476
until your sister stopped him,

00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:58.521
saving him from possibly
the greatest social humiliation

00:14:58.522 --> 00:15:00.983
that a freshman has ever experienced
at Hawkins High?

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:03.861
What color was this mohawk?

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:05.445
Hot orange.

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:09.574
And personally, I think the use
of the word "hot" is a bit ironic, but...

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.242
People say I'm too negative.

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:12.745
I just think I'm honest.

00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:36.852
Come on.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:46.987
Welcome.

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:06.173
Hey.

00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.175
It even comes with a view.

00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:32.491
Where are we?

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.784
In a memory.

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:39.622
Which exists inside a world
of 1,000 memories.

00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:41.250
I know it might look nice,

00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:43.293
but it's not.

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:46.755
This place, this world...

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.216
It's a prison.

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:56.849
Henry's prison.

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.834
It's okay, sweetie.

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:28.463
These are the good guys.
They're going to keep everyone safe.

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:32.383
Just try and think of this
as a field trip.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:35.137
Mm-hmm. A learning expedition.

00:17:47.524 --> 00:17:53.030
Cargo has arrived.
I repeat, cargo has arrived.

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:58.619
They're taking them into a barracks
second from the library.

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.669
Tunnels.

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:17.595
Yeah. See? The north tunnel of the MAC-Z
runs right underneath the barracks.

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.889
- Lucky break.
- Bound to happen one of these days.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.682
Gonna need more luck
if we want this plan to work.

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:24.602
If we're right, the military is trying
to protect these kids.

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:26.479
So this barracks
is gonna be heavily guarded.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.981
We have to dig up
into the barracks, unnoticed,

00:18:28.982 --> 00:18:31.275
grab the kids, get them to Murray,
smuggle them out of Hawkins.

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:33.486
All before anyone notices they're gone.

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:35.239
- Dick.
- What?

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:37.366
What? Oh.

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.993
Sorry. Did I say that out loud?
I thought I was talking in my head.

00:18:40.994 --> 00:18:43.288
But you guys know
Tom, Dick, and Harry, right?

00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:47.625
Seriously? None of you have seen
The Great Escape?

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:51.295
Basically, it's about these POWs, right?

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:54.298
And they're stuck
in a barracks just like this one.

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:56.175
They need to escape,
so they dig these tunnels,

00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:58.678
and they call their tunnels
Tom, Dick, and Harry.

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:00.596
They have to hide the tunnels
from the Nazis.

00:19:00.597 --> 00:19:03.933
So they put Tom in this dark corner,
and they put Harry under the stove,

00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:08.147
and they put Dick in the washroom.
And personally, for us, I like Dick.

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:15.862
Oh, um... Sorry. The washroom.
I actually don't even... Never mind.

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:17.739
Okay, say we go with Dick.

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:20.116
How do we find the washroom?

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:21.742
And how do we get the kids to it?

00:19:21.743 --> 00:19:24.245
How do we know
which kids are being targeted by Vecna?

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:27.832
We use an inside man,
someone who could get into the barracks,

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:31.085
measure the distance to the washroom,
find out which kids have seen Mr. Whatsit,

00:19:31.086 --> 00:19:32.753
and somehow avoid the military.

00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:36.007
Well, that's a lovely plan,
but isn't it a tad...

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.216
Mission Impossible-y.

00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:40.595
Yeah. I mean, Mike,
who are you gonna get to do this?

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:41.762
Bond? Magnum?

00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:43.806
No, no, we don't want a superspy.

00:19:43.807 --> 00:19:46.560
We want the opposite.
We want someone no one would suspect.

00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:49.604
Someone that could just walk in,
no questions asked.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:52.065
The one kid
the military failed to wrangle.

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:00.073
What?

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:34.440
Two grunts in the tower by the west gate.

00:20:34.441 --> 00:20:36.901
One more in the tower by the east gate.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.112
One, two, three, four on the ground.

00:20:39.988 --> 00:20:42.573
I hope to God you're right,
and Vecna is in there,

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:44.825
because we might just die
trying to break in.

00:20:44.826 --> 00:20:45.952
I am right.

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:49.039
You can't be right about everything.
Your theories aren't exactly lining up.

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:51.707
- Why not?
- You heard kryptonite.

00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:53.668
If Vecna's in there,
he doesn't have his powers.

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:54.877
If he doesn't have his powers,

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:57.129
how could he have anything to do
with Holly's kidnapping?

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.882
You can ask him before I kill him.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.343
How high is that fence?

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:04.011
Hey, you're not jumping that.

00:21:04.012 --> 00:21:05.388
Why not?

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:09.725
Because this is not training.
This is a real-world situation.

00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:12.104
And that roof is metal.

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:15.481
You hit that on a jump,
you're gonna alert the whole damn base.

00:21:15.482 --> 00:21:17.024
Not if I time it with the thunder.

00:21:17.025 --> 00:21:18.693
Yeah.

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:20.237
It's seven seconds.

00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:30.998
One, two, three, four, five, six...

00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:35.418
Seven.

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:36.962
Okay. You got lucky.

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.339
- Hopper, do you copy?
- Dustin!

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.924
Over. This is Dustin.

00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:44.510
Hopper, do you copy? This is Dustin.

00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:47.054
Hey, hey, it's Hop. I copy.

00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:49.890
Holy shit! Okay. They're alive!

00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:51.058
El! Ask about El.

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:52.351
El. Is El with you? Over.

00:21:52.352 --> 00:21:54.270
Yes. I'm here. Over.

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:56.355
Okay. Yay. Terrific.

00:21:56.356 --> 00:21:59.108
I don't know if you're caught up
in something important, but--

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:00.192
- Dustin. Come on.
- Meet us!

00:22:00.193 --> 00:22:02.653
Meet us at Roane Cemetery church, please.

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:05.740
Roane Cemetery. How the hell
are you contacting us from there?

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:08.784
Right. You don't know.
We're in the Upside Down.

00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:09.827
What?

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:12.955
Long story short, we're here to track
a Demogorgon using our telemetry tracker,

00:22:12.956 --> 00:22:15.958
only to then hit a wall. Literally.
Now, Steve's beamer is stuck,

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:18.127
so we need El to come and pry it loose
using her powers

00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:20.004
so we can resume the search
for said Demogorgon

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:23.257
which will, in theory, lead us to Holly.
Does any of this make sense?

00:22:23.258 --> 00:22:26.761
Do you need additional details?
Questions? Concerns? Over.

00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:28.013
You hit a wall?

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:30.766
What kind of wall, exactly?

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:36.271
Uh... it's a bit... hard to describe.

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:38.982
- Sort of...
- Huge?

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.400
Disgusting.

00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:43.570
Smells like Henderson's armpit.

00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:46.614
We hit the same thing,
but not at the Roane Cemetery.

00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:49.451
We hit it a quarter mile southeast
of the old Hagen Bridge.

00:22:50.243 --> 00:22:52.162
That's the opposite side of town.

00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:54.497
Fascinating.

00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:56.791
We don't know what it is,
but we think Holly's behind it.

00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:59.586
Don't bother trying to break through.
You can't.

00:23:00.128 --> 00:23:01.296
We're working on a solution.

00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:04.925
- Nancy.
- Solution? What kind of solution?

00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:08.677
Wait, what kind of solution? Hopper!

00:23:08.678 --> 00:23:11.472
Listen, we gotta keep the airwaves clear,
all right?

00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:13.850
We'll come get you. Just stay put.

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.144
You think they're safe?

00:23:17.145 --> 00:23:18.939
I mean, compared to us? Yeah.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.941
Okay.

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.026
Let's go see
if that training has paid off.

00:23:24.027 --> 00:23:25.904
You're gonna let me jump?

00:23:27.114 --> 00:23:29.324
Let's go before I change my mind.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.041
Vecna's curse,

00:23:39.459 --> 00:23:40.752
it never goes away.

00:23:41.628 --> 00:23:42.629
Never leaves you.

00:23:43.338 --> 00:23:46.382
With each victim that he took,
he created a new gate.

00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:48.510
A gate to the Upside Down?

00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:53.556
When he took me,
he opened the fourth, final gate,

00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:54.808
splitting Hawkins in two.

00:23:56.893 --> 00:24:03.607
Wait, but if Mr. Whatsit...
I mean Henry, took you, how are you here?

00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:05.193
You mean, shouldn't I be dead?

00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.864
It's okay. It's a fair question.

00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:10.866
I definitely should be.

00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:13.535
And for a moment...

00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:15.912
I was.

00:24:19.374 --> 00:24:21.083
I don't know how long I was gone.

00:24:21.084 --> 00:24:25.589
But then I felt something... calling to me.

00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:19.308
Life could be dream

00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:22.270
If I could take you up
In Paradise up above

00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:24.688
If you would tell me I'm the only...

00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:28.192
One night only. Don't miss it.
Tickets are only 50 cents.

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:30.486
That's two quarters for you poindexters.

00:25:30.487 --> 00:25:35.157
- Joyce! This that stupid play of yours?
- I better see you there, Harrington.

00:25:35.158 --> 00:25:37.410
Friday night? You wish.

00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:40.329
Life could be dream

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.914
Nice shot, jerk.

00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:44.042
If only all my precious plans
Would come true

00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:48.712
Somehow, I was in another time.

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:50.131
Hawkins.

00:25:51.508 --> 00:25:52.967
Thirty years ago.

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:54.177
Time travel.

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:57.931
Only, I wasn't actually there.

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.350
Not really. I was just...

00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:02.686
an observer.

00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:08.024
And that's when I understood.

00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:12.027
I was trapped inside Henry's mind,
his memories.

00:26:12.028 --> 00:26:15.072
Like a nightmare prison world

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:19.119
ruled by an evil,
psychopathic piece of shit.

00:26:20.036 --> 00:26:21.161
Like Camazotz.

00:26:21.162 --> 00:26:23.205
Cama... What?

00:26:23.206 --> 00:26:25.542
Camazotz. From A Wrinkle in Time.

00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:27.543
- Never read it.
- You should. It's amazing.

00:26:27.544 --> 00:26:30.588
Camazotz is like this dark planet
that's under the control of IT,

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.840
which is this giant,
disembodied, evil brain.

00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:34.925
Anyways, Meg's dad...
Meg's the main character.

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:36.468
...he gets taken prisoner there.

00:26:36.469 --> 00:26:39.722
So, Henry's kinda like IT,
and you're kinda like Meg's dad.

00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:40.974
Okay. Well...

00:26:41.474 --> 00:26:44.852
I don't know if Meg's dad would agree,
but the way I see it,

00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:48.731
when you're a prisoner
in a messed up prison world,

00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:50.859
you really only have
a few doors open to you.

00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:54.738
Door one, you take your own life.

00:26:56.031 --> 00:26:58.699
Door two, accept your fate.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.161
- Or door three...
- You escape.

00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:04.414
- I chose door three.
- That seems like the best door.

00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:07.584
So, I kept moving.

00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:10.628
From memory to memory.

00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:13.840
Only, this place is a maze.

00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:19.011
I became lost, turned around.
I got so turned around,

00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:21.931
I actually ended up
right back at the beginning.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.735
And that's when I heard her.

00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:38.573
I heard Kate Bush.

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:40.533
Is she one of your friends?

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.452
You could say that.

00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:46.665
Do you wanna hear
About the deal that I'm making?

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:51.585
Music has a way of finding you,
even in the darkest of places.

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:55.882
Lucas had used it before, to reach me,
to guide me out of Vecna's mind,

00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:57.425
back to the light.

00:27:58.802 --> 00:28:02.805
If I only could make a deal with God

00:28:02.806 --> 00:28:05.974
And I'd get him to swap our places

00:28:05.975 --> 00:28:08.060
Be runnin' up that road

00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:13.316
So, this music was coming from Lucas,
from the real world?

00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:19.948
Even after all this time,

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:22.826
he hadn't given up on me.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.662
If you follow this music,

00:28:26.621 --> 00:28:27.580
then what?

00:28:28.623 --> 00:28:30.625
Then it would lead me out of here.

00:28:32.585 --> 00:28:33.586
Back home.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.757
At least, that's what I thought.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.553
But then...

00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:47.307
everything went wrong.

00:28:47.308 --> 00:28:50.520
Oh, come on, angel
Come on, come on, darlin'

00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:53.064
Let's exchange the...

00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:14.794
Hey!

00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:20.841
What the hell are you doing?
Can't you read, kid? No trespassing.

00:29:20.842 --> 00:29:22.843
Right, I see that, officer.

00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:25.513
It's just... my school is missing.

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:33.229
Let's go.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.574
Move it.

00:29:49.996 --> 00:29:52.706
Holy shit! Are those laser blasters?

00:29:52.707 --> 00:29:54.082
Might just be.

00:29:54.083 --> 00:29:56.628
And they'll blast you
if you don't keep it moving.

00:30:00.924 --> 00:30:02.883
- Boys.
- Can't get me!

00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:03.968
Boys!

00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:08.348
All right. Absolutely not.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.850
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

00:30:11.518 --> 00:30:14.520
This is Private Chapman.
You do exactly as he says.

00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:17.272
You got any questions, direct them to him.

00:30:17.273 --> 00:30:20.235
Where might I relieve myself?

00:30:22.904 --> 00:30:24.197
Breaking bar.

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:26.115
Shovel.

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:29.369
Five safety goggles.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.621
A surveyor's wheel and...

00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:34.165
Hold for applause.

00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:41.213
Santa's sleigh is ready for his reindeer.

00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:45.634
We got built-in benches,
seat belts, foam padding.

00:30:45.635 --> 00:30:48.428
Everything a kidnapped child could desire.

00:30:48.429 --> 00:30:49.596
Foam padding?

00:30:49.597 --> 00:30:52.934
Don't want to break any eggs en route,
now do we?

00:30:53.768 --> 00:30:57.646
I'm in. Do you copy?
Repeat, I'm in. Do you copy?

00:30:57.647 --> 00:31:00.315
Yes, yes, we copy. We copy. Where are you?

00:31:00.316 --> 00:31:03.819
Bathroom. Back stall.
45 of my paces from the front entrance.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.738
Good job. Now round up anyone
who's seen Mr. Whatsit,

00:31:06.739 --> 00:31:08.156
and we'll be there soon.

00:31:08.157 --> 00:31:11.660
And remember, you're not Dipshit Derek.
You're--

00:31:11.661 --> 00:31:13.079
Delightful Derek.

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:28.927
Okay, once you get
that gate open, and I'm inside...

00:31:28.928 --> 00:31:30.971
- You lead.
- That's right.

00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:32.056
And you?

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:36.436
I will destroy your kryptonite.
Don't worry.

00:31:37.604 --> 00:31:38.605
Okay.

00:32:20.563 --> 00:32:23.816
All right, come on.
Come on, you got this. You got this.

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:56.474
Wait. You're too early. You're too early.

00:33:02.772 --> 00:33:03.690
God.

00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:07.944
Sorry.

00:33:12.782 --> 00:33:15.367
You trying to give
your old man a heart attack?

00:33:15.368 --> 00:33:16.953
Nice job, by the way.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.835
Hop?

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:25.962
Yeah?

00:33:27.588 --> 00:33:28.589
Thank you.

00:33:29.215 --> 00:33:30.049
For what?

00:33:30.633 --> 00:33:31.759
For teaching me.

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:34.887
And trusting me.

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:37.348
Always.

00:33:44.063 --> 00:33:46.440
The day of reckoning has arrived.

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:48.817
With this in mind,
I've been sent by Mr. Whatsit

00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:50.152
to gather the chosen ones.

00:33:50.153 --> 00:33:52.821
If you've been visited by Mr. Whatsit,
speak now.

00:33:52.822 --> 00:33:55.407
And when night falls,
follow me to the latrine,

00:33:55.408 --> 00:33:58.703
and I will lead you
to our savior, to safety.

00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:01.706
Derek's gone mental.

00:34:03.499 --> 00:34:06.294
The monsters are coming,
and you're all gonna die.

00:34:08.212 --> 00:34:09.255
Derek?

00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:12.175
Were you talking about Henry?

00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:25.353
Any word from Derek yet?

00:34:25.354 --> 00:34:26.772
Not yet.

00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:29.399
Just give him time.
It hasn't been that long.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.735
I just can't get over the fact

00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:36.281
that the fate of the world rests
on Derek freakin' Turnbow.

00:34:36.282 --> 00:34:39.534
When you look in the mirror, do you see
a Navy SEAL looking back at you?

00:34:39.535 --> 00:34:42.622
Sometimes people need
someone to believe in them.

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:46.209
And then they can do amazing things.

00:34:46.709 --> 00:34:49.087
Your mom and Robin
are getting along better.

00:34:49.837 --> 00:34:52.923
Well, it didn't hurt
that Mom scared off that Demo.

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:55.885
Saved Robin's life, everybody's life.

00:34:59.013 --> 00:35:02.641
So, when your mom, when she had her axe,

00:35:02.642 --> 00:35:04.017
you could see her?

00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:06.019
- Like, through the Demo's eyes?
- Yeah.

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.480
And I was so close to the hive,

00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:13.110
it's like I could feel
what it was feeling, like this anger.

00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:15.570
That I was still in there too.

00:35:15.571 --> 00:35:17.948
And I was afraid. I was afraid for my mom.

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:21.661
- You wanted to protect her.
- Yeah. But I... I just couldn't.

00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:25.039
It was like this scary movie
you just can't turn off.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.795
Open sesame.

00:35:32.046 --> 00:35:35.258
Oh. Well, have fun.

00:35:36.008 --> 00:35:37.051
Thanks.

00:35:37.927 --> 00:35:40.387
- Are you positive you didn't?
- Didn't what?

00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:41.555
Turn off the scary movie.

00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:43.306
Protect your mom,
not the other way around.

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:46.059
No offense. I know she's badass
and everything, but you know.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.686
- Yeah, she's 5'3".
- Yeah!

00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:50.939
And Vecna likes to control the hive mind
like a puppet master.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.984
So maybe when you tap into the hive,
you can pull the strings too.

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:56.153
Except I'm not Vecna.

00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:57.238
You sorta are.

00:35:57.947 --> 00:36:01.032
You're trying to say that I'm evil
and hell-bent on destroying the world?

00:36:01.033 --> 00:36:02.075
Totally.

00:36:02.076 --> 00:36:05.579
No, I'm just saying that, you know,
you're like a wizard like him.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.622
In D&D, Mike, not real life.

00:36:07.623 --> 00:36:10.083
True. In real life,
you're more like a sorcerer,

00:36:10.084 --> 00:36:13.004
because your powers don't come
from a book of spells. They're innate.

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:17.174
Listen, as far as crazy theories go,
I've had crazier.

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:20.428
And with Eleven in the Upside Down,
we really need some magic up here.

00:36:58.799 --> 00:37:00.550
Working on a solution?

00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:04.721
I mean, if Hopper has a solution
to get through this and to get to Holly,

00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:06.431
he should... he should share it with us!

00:37:06.432 --> 00:37:08.141
I just say we ignore the old man.

00:37:08.142 --> 00:37:10.852
We keep moving.
Look for a door or something.

00:37:10.853 --> 00:37:13.480
Yeah, and just curious.

00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:16.358
This door of yours,
it's soft like a Peanut Butter Bopper?

00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:18.526
You got something to say, Byers,
why don't you say it?

00:37:18.527 --> 00:37:21.238
I'm just saying maybe you shouldn't be
making the calls from now on.

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:24.992
It was not just his call.
It was mine because it's my sister.

00:37:25.952 --> 00:37:26.953
And...

00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:30.372
I agree with Steve.
Okay, we can't just sit here.

00:37:30.373 --> 00:37:34.376
I don't know about a door,
but this wall can't go on forever.

00:37:34.377 --> 00:37:36.253
There has to be a way around it.

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:37.380
There isn't.

00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:40.507
This wall is a circle.

00:37:40.508 --> 00:37:43.176
A circle completely surrounding
the Upside Down.

00:37:43.177 --> 00:37:44.678
Oh yeah? How do you figure that?

00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:47.431
Because unlike you,
I didn't sleep through Algebra 1.

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:53.853
My telemetry tracker picked up
a weird frequency coming from the wall,

00:37:53.854 --> 00:37:57.232
and it took me a bit to place,
but I've heard it before.

00:37:57.233 --> 00:37:59.859
Rather, we have.
Remember when we were out looking for Hop,

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.611
and you heard that sound
off of Irwin Road?

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:04.155
- Yeah. You said it was interference.
- It was.

00:38:04.156 --> 00:38:07.951
But this interference, it wasn't coming
from a military broadcast or an EMI.

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:10.787
It was coming from this wall,
which is important,

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:13.373
because that gives us
three known locations.

00:38:13.374 --> 00:38:14.958
So, I connected the dots,

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:17.669
measured the midpoints,
drew the perpendicular bisectors--

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.089
All right! Yeah, we're not your teachers.
We don't need to see your work.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.258
We get it.
You think it's all a big circle.

00:38:23.259 --> 00:38:26.636
I don't think. I know. I triple checked,
and my calculations are correct.

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:29.848
Whatever! I still don't see
how this gets us closer to finding Holly.

00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:33.144
Because it's not about the circle.
It's about the center.

00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:37.773
The DOE. The Department of Energy.

00:38:38.274 --> 00:38:40.359
- That's--
- Hawkins Lab.

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:43.194
What are the chances
that the center of this wall

00:38:43.195 --> 00:38:45.655
happens to be in the place
where all of this started,

00:38:45.656 --> 00:38:47.657
where the Upside Down was created?

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:49.327
So, the lab created the wall?

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.663
No idea. But I think we should find out.

00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:54.248
Don't you?

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:03.716
The music, it led me to a new memory.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.011
Only, something was different
about this memory.

00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:09.597
I was there.

00:39:10.973 --> 00:39:12.767
It was the day that Henry cursed me.

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:15.227
It was his first memory of me.

00:39:16.645 --> 00:39:19.940
I know, as if this goddamn place
wasn't heady enough, right?

00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:23.319
But I still had the music to guide me.

00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:25.696
So I followed it.

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:30.826
And it led me through new memories.

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:38.708
Terrible memories.

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:42.088
- Let go!
- Follow me into death.

00:39:56.811 --> 00:39:59.105
And it felt like they would never end.

00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:05.778
But then eventually, they did.

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:10.032
It was the night that Vecna killed me.

00:40:12.827 --> 00:40:14.453
The night he took me prisoner.

00:40:15.704 --> 00:40:17.455
Yeah, yeah, yo

00:40:17.456 --> 00:40:20.166
Do you wanna know
Know that it doesn't hurt me?

00:40:20.167 --> 00:40:21.835
I'd finally found it.

00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:25.714
Do you wanna hear
About the deal that I'm making?

00:40:27.007 --> 00:40:28.551
The way out.

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:34.348
It's you and me

00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:38.726
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God

00:40:38.727 --> 00:40:40.813
And I'd get him to swap...

00:40:47.736 --> 00:40:49.321
And I was so close.

00:40:52.867 --> 00:40:55.619
So close
that I could feel his hand on mine.

00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:00.207
And it was like I was there.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.086
Like I was with him in that hospital.

00:41:12.845 --> 00:41:16.639
Come on, Angel
Come on, come on, darling

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.394
Let's exchange the experience

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:32.490
No.

00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:34.366
No.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:40.831
Lucas!

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:45.878
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!

00:41:49.381 --> 00:41:50.508
Hello, Max.

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:55.763
I ran.

00:41:58.641 --> 00:41:59.850
And I kept running.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.553
I'll never forget
the look on his face that day.

00:42:36.512 --> 00:42:38.471
He was scared.

00:42:38.472 --> 00:42:42.184
More than scared, he was terrified.

00:42:42.768 --> 00:42:44.603
There's something about this cave...

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:47.064
this memory.

00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:50.901
He won't come in.

00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:53.696
In here,

00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:55.823
I'm safe.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.868
So I turned it into my sanctuary.

00:43:03.539 --> 00:43:04.540
My home.

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:08.627
I took door two.

00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:11.755
Shitty door two.

00:43:14.174 --> 00:43:15.593
Accept your fate.

00:43:16.635 --> 00:43:17.678
That was,

00:43:18.804 --> 00:43:20.222
until you showed up.

00:43:21.473 --> 00:43:23.267
And now door three is back.

00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:25.853
Escape.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.231
I have a plan,
a plan to get us out of here.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.276
And it's gonna take time,
more time than we have now.

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:35.486
Henry will return to his house soon.

00:43:35.487 --> 00:43:38.406
And when he does,
he cannot know that you're gone.

00:43:38.407 --> 00:43:40.284
You want me to go back there?

00:43:41.243 --> 00:43:42.827
Back to him? Back to Henry? No, I--

00:43:42.828 --> 00:43:44.871
I know. It's scary.

00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:50.085
But if you wanna get out of here,
if you wanna escape Camazotz,

00:43:50.669 --> 00:43:52.087
this is the only way.

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:55.049
It's the only way.

00:44:00.554 --> 00:44:02.097
Tell me what I need to do.

00:44:21.033 --> 00:44:21.908
Hey, wh--

00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:23.243
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:30.041
Do you, um, by any chance,
remember Tammy Thompson?

00:44:30.042 --> 00:44:32.835
Yeah. Isn't she that terrible singer?

00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:34.587
Yeah.

00:44:34.588 --> 00:44:36.089
But in the ninth grade,

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.801
I thought that she sounded
like Whitney goddamn Houston.

00:44:39.802 --> 00:44:45.390
I mean, the first time I saw her,
oh my God, like, time slowed down.

00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:47.975
It was like a scene
from some lame-o movie.

00:44:47.976 --> 00:44:52.064
You know, her hair blew in the wind,
and she just looked perfect.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.273
So goddamn perfect.

00:44:54.274 --> 00:44:57.861
And, uh, it was right then and there
that I knew she was the one.

00:44:58.445 --> 00:45:02.908
That with Tammy, I would finally be able
to be myself, you know, all of myself.

00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:08.413
Because there was always this part of me
that kind of scared me, you know?

00:45:08.414 --> 00:45:12.417
But I thought
that if Tammy loved me, all of me,

00:45:12.418 --> 00:45:15.878
you know, I wouldn't be so scared anymore.

00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:19.382
And then he showed up,
Steve "The Hair" Harrington.

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:20.925
Oh God.

00:45:20.926 --> 00:45:22.677
You probably can guess the rest.

00:45:22.678 --> 00:45:25.472
Tammy fell for him hard.

00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:31.436
And my entire fantasy life with her,
along with the rest of my life,

00:45:31.437 --> 00:45:33.271
pretty much imploded before my eyes.

00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:35.523
I mean, my grades plummeted.
I got grounded.

00:45:35.524 --> 00:45:37.692
I had to stay home every weekend
doing chores.

00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:41.028
But then one day, I was cleaning bat shit
out of my parents' garage,

00:45:41.029 --> 00:45:43.573
and I found this 8-millimeter film reel.
You know?

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:46.951
And it was just from this silly movie
that I made in fourth grade,

00:45:46.952 --> 00:45:48.870
but I got it up on the projector,

00:45:48.871 --> 00:45:53.791
and all of a sudden, I was looking
at this little version of myself.

00:45:53.792 --> 00:45:57.253
And that little me,
I could hardly recognize her.

00:45:57.254 --> 00:46:00.591
You know, she was so carefree

00:46:01.717 --> 00:46:04.011
and, like, fearless.

00:46:04.678 --> 00:46:06.555
She just loved every part of herself.

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.141
And that's when it hit me.

00:46:09.808 --> 00:46:12.352
It was never about Tone-deaf Tammy.

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:16.815
It was always just about me.

00:46:17.524 --> 00:46:19.818
I was looking for answers
in somebody else, but...

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.822
I had all the answers.

00:46:24.698 --> 00:46:27.534
I just needed to stop being
so goddamn scared.

00:46:28.535 --> 00:46:31.914
Scared of... who I really was.

00:46:32.915 --> 00:46:34.958
Once I did that, oh,

00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:37.795
I felt so free.

00:46:38.587 --> 00:46:42.089
It's like I could fly, you know?
Like, I could finally be...

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.550
Rockin' Robin.

00:46:44.843 --> 00:46:47.137
Yeah. Rockin' Robin.

00:46:48.347 --> 00:46:49.889
Hey, guys!

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.433
Take your time, will ya?

00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:58.022
Did you finally hit Dick?

00:46:58.023 --> 00:46:59.607
- Hit the Dick.
- Yep.

00:46:59.608 --> 00:47:01.692
Let's just hope it's not too hard.

00:47:01.693 --> 00:47:02.861
If it is,

00:47:03.862 --> 00:47:04.947
I'll soften it.

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:11.537
Hey!

00:47:12.788 --> 00:47:13.831
Hey!

00:47:15.207 --> 00:47:16.458
Hey!

00:47:18.585 --> 00:47:19.920
Take me to Kay.

00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:41.859
Damn it! Damn it!

00:47:46.405 --> 00:47:49.658
Make a sound, it'll be your last.
Nod if you understand.

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:55.247
Move! Move it! Come on, let's go!

00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:57.082
Come on!

00:47:59.167 --> 00:48:00.252
It's not working.

00:48:01.461 --> 00:48:03.337
- How do we get through?
- I don't have clearance.

00:48:03.338 --> 00:48:06.591
I didn't ask if you have clearance.
I asked, how do we get through?

00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:07.800
You can't.

00:48:07.801 --> 00:48:11.387
Dr. Kay, your boss, she got clearance?

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:12.514
I don't know.

00:48:13.348 --> 00:48:14.349
You don't know.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.935
Thanks for your help.

00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:18.604
Plan B.

00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:45.130
- Stop! Stop!
- El!

00:48:46.506 --> 00:48:48.133
- El!
- Stop!

00:49:26.254 --> 00:49:27.547
We're through.

00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:37.599
Oh, shit.

00:49:58.412 --> 00:49:59.371
Oh, shit.

00:50:05.544 --> 00:50:09.588
I want you to close your eyes
and focus on your breathing.

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:11.924
Breathe in and out.

00:50:11.925 --> 00:50:14.010
As you continue breathing,

00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:16.887
I want you to picture yourself on a beach.

00:50:16.888 --> 00:50:20.433
The water is blue. Blue as a Smurf.

00:50:20.434 --> 00:50:26.064
You listen to it lap the sandy shore,
like a dog slurping from his bowl.

00:50:32.404 --> 00:50:35.197
It's called visualization.

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:37.200
Mom does it when she's out of Valium.

00:50:49.629 --> 00:50:50.797
Go.

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:37.177
Howdy.

00:51:41.598 --> 00:51:47.645
Feel the sand under your butt.
It feels cool and soft.

00:51:47.646 --> 00:51:49.898
...time. There you go.

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:52.901
Good job, good job. All right.

00:51:53.902 --> 00:51:56.695
Hey, sweetie. Um, what's your name?

00:51:56.696 --> 00:51:58.197
Debbie.

00:51:58.198 --> 00:52:00.032
Do you work for Mr. Whatsit?

00:52:00.033 --> 00:52:01.242
Mr. Whatsit.

00:52:01.243 --> 00:52:04.703
Oh. Um, yes. Of course.
I'm one of his elves.

00:52:04.704 --> 00:52:07.582
You know, like a... a magic elf.

00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:27.393
Right here. A couple more steps.

00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:29.562
All right. Yes, okay.

00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:32.774
All right. Great job. Step by step.

00:52:48.582 --> 00:52:49.958
Shit.

00:53:27.078 --> 00:53:27.913
Eleven.

00:53:29.289 --> 00:53:33.293
I have been looking for you
for a very long time.

00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.170
My name is--

00:53:36.171 --> 00:53:37.339
Dr. Kay.

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:41.259
I know who you are.

00:53:43.303 --> 00:53:45.347
I know who you've taken.

00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:51.102
And I also know...

00:53:53.647 --> 00:53:55.232
that you and your men...

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:59.110
are going to die.

00:54:29.307 --> 00:54:30.600
What the hell?

00:55:35.582 --> 00:55:37.667
It's best not to struggle.

00:55:38.877 --> 00:55:43.340
The greater the perceived threat,
the more aggressive its response.

00:55:49.262 --> 00:55:51.138
Miss Robin, what about the others?

00:55:51.139 --> 00:55:53.599
Uh, just Robin. And don't worry.
They're right behind us.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.934
- Something's wrong, isn't it?
- No. No, siree.

00:55:55.935 --> 00:55:57.896
Everything is going
exactly according to plan.

00:55:58.938 --> 00:56:01.690
- Airlock-- Wrap it with your jacket.
- I got it.

00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:03.734
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

00:56:03.735 --> 00:56:05.362
Here. Try it--

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:10.282
Hey. Sorry.
Bit of a plumbing problem here.

00:56:10.283 --> 00:56:12.243
Are you by chance looking for Mr. Whatsit?

00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:15.330
- Right through there.
- Right there.

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:28.343
There's a little breeze
in the air telling you a secret.

00:56:29.344 --> 00:56:32.597
You look up at the sky,
searching for clouds, but all you--

00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:51.408
Mr. Whatsit?

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.204
Shit!

00:56:57.205 --> 00:56:58.580
Officer! Officer!

00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:00.207
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, calm down.

00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:01.417
- What's going on?
- Shitballs.

00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:02.334
Good job, man.

00:57:02.335 --> 00:57:04.962
- Lucas! We've been spotted!
- No, no!

00:57:04.963 --> 00:57:06.255
Get 'em out of here. Go.

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:08.382
- What about the others?
- Just go! Go, go, go!

00:57:08.383 --> 00:57:09.801
Damn it! Okay, come on, guys.

00:57:14.639 --> 00:57:18.434
Move! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

00:57:18.435 --> 00:57:19.893
Hey, stop right there!

00:57:19.894 --> 00:57:22.021
Ashley Klein is a snitch!

00:57:24.023 --> 00:57:24.941
Hey!

00:57:30.405 --> 00:57:32.574
Open the door! Open the goddamn door!

00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:41.458
So you're the reason.

00:57:42.333 --> 00:57:45.670
The reason she's been so hard to track.

00:57:46.504 --> 00:57:49.883
The thorn in my side.

00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:58.183
And after all that effort to hide her,
you bring her here, of all places?

00:57:59.726 --> 00:58:00.727
Why?

00:58:01.895 --> 00:58:04.898
Why risk her life for the other?

00:58:06.691 --> 00:58:08.902
What do you know that I don't?

00:58:15.909 --> 00:58:19.120
It's actually holding back,
if you can believe it.

00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:21.664
That heat you feel...

00:58:23.041 --> 00:58:24.584
weakens it.

00:58:29.297 --> 00:58:32.509
But in the cold, it thrives.

00:58:36.638 --> 00:58:38.640
I can stop it.

00:58:39.224 --> 00:58:41.142
But you're gonna have to start talking.

00:58:59.911 --> 00:59:01.079
Go to hell.

00:59:15.802 --> 00:59:18.888
In your current state,
I'm afraid that won't work.

00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:31.317
Not the sharpest, are we?

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.964
You're too late. Cavalry's on its way.

00:59:53.965 --> 00:59:55.466
That's all right.

00:59:56.634 --> 00:59:57.719
I'll be quick.

01:00:10.481 --> 01:00:11.523
Grocery delivery.

01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:13.025
Where's everyone else?

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.277
Coming.

01:00:17.196 --> 01:00:20.907
Come on, sweetie. Come on down. Come on.

01:00:20.908 --> 01:00:24.120
You get down here right now,
or a monster's gonna eat you.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.497
Open the door!

01:00:27.498 --> 01:00:28.874
You little shit!

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.251
Get out of the way!

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:31.961
About goddamn time!

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:44.389
I got you. That's good. Good, good.

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:46.851
Hey there.
Where do you think you're going?

01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:01.658
What are you doing?

01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:05.995
Hey, you gotta go. You gotta go. Come on.

01:01:09.707 --> 01:01:11.458
We're gonna get to the woods.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:14.002
The kryptonite shit can't get you there.

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:16.672
Hop, we can't. We can't leave.
We came for Henry.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:19.966
Hey. You take this compass.
You're gonna follow it northeast.

01:01:19.967 --> 01:01:23.345
That'll take you to the graveyard.
You're gonna find Nancy and the others.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.472
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:26.474
What is that?

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:28.433
It's just a failsafe, okay?

01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:30.018
- It's a failsafe.
- No.

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:31.812
I gotta make sure he goes down with me.

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:34.523
- No. No, Hop.
- It's the only way. It's the only way.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.692
I'm not gonna risk losing you.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:37.902
I will not risk it.

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:40.779
- Hopper. No.
- Listen, I want you to know something.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.364
From here on out,

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.991
I want you to know how proud I am of you.

01:01:44.992 --> 01:01:48.371
I am so proud of you.
I am so proud of what you've overcome.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.041
I'm proud of who you are.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:57.713
No. No, Hop. Hopper!

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:01.467
- I love you, Jane.
- Hopper! No! Hopper!

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:09.642
Hop!

01:02:10.768 --> 01:02:11.978
Hopper!

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:15.398
Hopper!

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:16.941
Hop!

01:02:18.025 --> 01:02:19.068
Hopper!

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:29.162
Hopper! Hopper!

01:02:30.037 --> 01:02:31.706
Hopper!

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.296
Pulse ox is falling.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.924
Flatlining!

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:07.033
All right, kids. Come on.
Find a seat in the back.

01:03:11.412 --> 01:03:12.246
Hi.

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:14.581
All right.

01:03:14.582 --> 01:03:17.834
Okay, let's have some fun, huh?
This is gonna be great, huh?

01:03:17.835 --> 01:03:19.795
Okay. Let's get our seat belts on, hmm?

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:22.672
Safety first. Come on. Time's a-wastin'.

01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:23.632
Pretty comfy, huh?

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.091
Not really.

01:03:25.092 --> 01:03:26.885
Oh, sorry.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:29.888
Robin, Lucas, do you copy? Over.

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:30.889
Copy. It's Robin.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:32.058
Lucas. I copy.

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:35.143
We've got a problem here at the MAC.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.394
What kind of problem?

01:03:36.395 --> 01:03:38.564
Let go of me, you asshole!

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:42.692
You want to explain to me
what in God's name is going on here?

01:03:42.693 --> 01:03:43.944
Get the hell off me.

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:46.780
- We've got five missing kids, sir.
- You've lost five kids?

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:48.198
- How is that possible?
- This woman--

01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:49.366
Joyce Byers.

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:50.742
She broke into the barracks.

01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:53.495
She's been helping them escape
through some kind of tunnel.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.413
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

01:03:55.414 --> 01:04:00.085
Listen. These kids, they are not safe,
okay? They are in danger.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:02.462
And why exactly do you think
they're here, ma'am? Hmm?

01:04:02.463 --> 01:04:03.922
They're under our protection.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:06.883
If I may interject, officer.
I've seen what's coming.

01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:11.471
And no disrespect meant,
but you and your men can't protect shit!

01:04:11.472 --> 01:04:13.014
- Private!
- Hey! Hey!

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:14.516
- Get off him!
- Hey, Private!

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:18.271
What the hell is wrong with you,
Private? Keep your hands off him.

01:04:23.234 --> 01:04:25.652
Is that all the military does? Hit kids?

01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:28.239
- Will!
- Will! Will! Will!

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:31.117
Are you okay? Baby, are you okay?

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:38.916
They're here.

01:05:14.952 --> 01:05:17.120
Take the nearest threat! Engage on sight!

01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:19.081
We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die!

01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:27.173
Guys! Guys! Guys!
Get behind me! Get behind me!

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:36.432
Get back!

01:05:48.986 --> 01:05:56.369
Under the beds! Under the beds!
Under the beds! Under the beds!

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:09.674
Stay behind me. Stay behind me.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.594
Move! Move! Move!

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:15.721
Will!

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:30.111
We are under attack.
I repeat, we are under attack.

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:42.914
We gotta go. We gotta go!

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:44.542
What about the other kids? Shit!

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:57.388
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.558
Come on, shall we?

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:02.560
We shall!

01:07:37.094 --> 01:07:39.596
We're getting out of here, all right?
Eyes on me! Stay close!

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:40.513
Okay, okay.

01:07:40.514 --> 01:07:42.266
Will, come on. Come on!

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.856
- Come on.
- Wait for me, please! Wait!

01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:52.358
I'm not ready to die!

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:54.862
- Wait up!
- Stay close!

01:07:55.362 --> 01:07:56.989
Derek! Hurry up, let's go!

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:03.412
- Is everybody okay? Are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:09.209
Okay. The Radio Shack. If we move
quick enough, I think we can make it.

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:11.086
Get into the tunnels and get out of here.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.295
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:08:12.296 --> 01:08:14.507
Eyes on me. Remember?

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:18.969
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:08:21.722 --> 01:08:22.598
All right, go!

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:27.645
Get some!

01:08:30.022 --> 01:08:32.066
Go, go, go! Oh my God.

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:40.825
Oh my God!

01:08:59.009 --> 01:09:01.303
Just hold on, baby! Hold on!

01:09:12.022 --> 01:09:15.317
- What the hell just happened?
- I have no idea, but I love it!

01:10:57.294 --> 01:10:58.587
Sister.

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:01.173
Sister.

01:12:07.948 --> 01:12:09.116
Unload!

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:20.294
Watch out!

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:47.821
Murray!

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:51.408
Son of a bitch!

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:56.372
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:02.503
Whoa!

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:06.589
The kids!

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:08.133
Hold on!

01:13:30.447 --> 01:13:32.282
Move, move, move! Let's go, guys!

01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:39.456
Back up, guys! Back up!

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:30.257
Stay away from him! You stay away!

01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:13.717
Can you see them...

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:16.094
William?

01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:21.099
Can you see the children?

01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:23.519
Do you know why?

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:30.776
Why I chose them to reshape the world?

01:15:35.405 --> 01:15:38.408
It's because they are weak.

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:47.459
Weak in body and mind.

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:54.091
Please!

01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:56.593
Easily broken.

01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:00.138
Easily reshaped.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.016
Controlled.

01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:08.313
The perfect vessels.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.900
And you...

01:16:12.943 --> 01:16:13.986
Will.

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:16.947
You were the first.

01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:24.871
And you broke so easily.

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:35.757
You showed me what was possible,

01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:38.135
what I could achieve.

01:16:40.178 --> 01:16:43.140
Some minds, it turns out,

01:16:44.349 --> 01:16:47.060
simply do not belong in this world.

01:16:54.192 --> 01:16:57.029
They belong in mine.

01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:49.163
I was looking for the answers
in somebody else, but...

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:51.667
I had all the answers.

01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:06.306
Do you wanna be friends?

01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:12.104
I just...

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:16.983
needed to stop being so goddamn scared.

01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:26.993
Scared of who I really was.

01:18:31.289 --> 01:18:33.583
Wow! It's so good!

01:18:59.025 --> 01:19:00.652
And once I did that,

01:19:01.319 --> 01:19:02.654
I was so free.

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:05.407
It's like I could fly.
