[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.940
[Episode 30]

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.240
They all say that these days,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.229
you've been frequenting the brothels
along the Qinhuai River.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.360
I didn't believe it.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.070
Of course, you shouldn't have believed it.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.930
Did you do that?

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.070
I went for one day.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.000
If I tell you

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.950
I was there on official business,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.150
would you believe me?

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.810
Do you believe it yourself?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.890
It's a bit complicated.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.430
Yes.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.870
At first, I didn't believe it either,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.950
but then all these people

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.760
from the brothels showed up at our home.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.400
I wished there was a crack in the ground

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.729
I could disappear into.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.030
Mother told us not to speak to you.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.680
You know me.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.150
I'm not that kind of person at all.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.070
They said

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.470
you visited more than 10 brothels
in a row.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.120
I didn't.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.460
You didn't?

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.090
Maybe 5 or 6.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.400
They said
you were drinking with courtesans

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.120
until you were completely drunk.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.650
I wasn't.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.710
You weren't?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.650
I wasn't completely drunk.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.870
They said you wrote an elegiac couplet

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.520
for a famous courtesan who just died.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.079
I didn't.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.800
You didn't?

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.910
His Excellency wrote it.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.310
You...

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.500
You've made Mother so angry.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.310
She said
you've become a beast with no morals!

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.310
What kind of talk is that?

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.329
How am I a beast?

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.630
Can you please listen to my explanation?

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.710
When I say I was on official business,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.620
I mean it!

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.840
The way of pen and sword demands

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.800
a balance between tension and relaxation!

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.329
Besides,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.590
visiting courtesans

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.320
is a common thing for a real man.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.150
Say that again.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.590
Where did you learn that?

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.520
I was confused in my anger.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.870
The brothel madam said it.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.430
Is that what you

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.230
really think?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.140
No.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.710
Yu'er,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.400
I think I've twisted my back.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.430
Help me up.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.960
Are you trying to murder your own husband?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.090
You hit way too hard.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.910
I...

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.240
I didn't push hard. Are you hurt?

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.630
Let me see.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.490
Just down here.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.560
You... You...

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.360
You...

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.430
You...

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.120
Alright, listen to my explanation.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.560
Nanjing is so desolate now.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.020
I need to revitalize the Qinhuai River
first

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.490
to attract merchants.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.010
These are just tactics.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.079
Why don't you mention that His Excellency

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:24.840
also went there?

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.520
He's even a Neo-Confucian scholar.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.780
Don't be angry with me.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.400
That's all explained?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.660
That's all explained.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.960
What's there to explain?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.840
-Cheating, huh?
-Blow the light and go to bed.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.440
Pingyuan.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.040
Mother wants you both

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.400
to stop arguing.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:51.710
Pingwen.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.960
Is my bedroom

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.200
a place you can enter whenever you want?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.680
I just came to the rescue.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.150
Mother was afraid you might fight.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.960
Fight?

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.930
You think Yu'er is like you?

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.240
She's understanding.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.800
Yu'er and I

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.520
couldn't possibly have
any misunderstanding.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.870
Do I need to explain anything to her?

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.300
Unlike you who jump at every chance...

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.470
You're sleeping outside tonight.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.280
Don't let Mother think I'm a pushover.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.740
Get out.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.750
No meat today.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.560
Is Mr. Gu in?

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.360
I'm...

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.480
Come in.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.630
I am Sun Er, Acting County Magistrate,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.160
paying my respects to you, Mr. Gu.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.720
No need for such formalities

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.800
when we're at home.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.750
Have you eaten yet?

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.270
Join us.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.750
Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Gu.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.880
I've already eaten.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.310
Mr. Gu, I'm here for your instructions.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.040
Official business so early in the morning?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.170
His Excellency said

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.800
that he was aware of the gifts

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.840
from the Qinhuai River yesterday,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.240
which are not considered a bribe.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.040
He asked you
to accept them without concern.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.750
He'll be responsible

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.950
if anything happens.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.680
I was wondering.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.920
I was wondering why last night

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.650
so many people came to my house.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.970
So those gifts

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.730
were meant
for the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.830
That was the original plan.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.159
But His Excellency said

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.680
the Qinhuai River
revitalization initiative

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.480
was your idea,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.159
so he can't accept the gifts.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.000
His Excellency

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.400
truly has a broad mind

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.600
and a noble character.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.560
Mr. Gu, you're incredibly resourceful,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.010
well,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.780
even surpassing Zhuge Liang.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.070
His Excellency

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.070
specifically mentioned

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.720
that he is a disciple of Confucius,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.600
and you are

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.160
a disciple of Master Guan Zhong.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.290
Please accept them with peace of mind.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.000
He's messing with me.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.040
His Excellency

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.190
has prepared the elegiac couplet

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.390
for the madam already

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.730
and some gifts as well.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.390
Today we'd like you

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.870
to represent
the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.560
on a visit to the Qinhuai River.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.160
Oh, right.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.870
He can't go himself.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.700
So I need your instructions—

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.690
shall we go by boat or by sedan chair?

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.190
Let's take a boat.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.160
It's more discreet.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.570
Yes.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.830
I'll be waiting outside

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.830
to accompany you.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.160
Good.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.430
Mother, are you still mad at me?

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.040
Do you think your son is the type

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.680
who would put on official robes

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.080
and then visit brothels?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.020
Or is it that

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.460
you're afraid
Yu'er will be taken advantage of?

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:51.550
Mr. Chang.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.240
We have a friendship
that runs deeper than blood.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.500
You can't not trust me.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.360
Stop taking Mr. Liao

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.740
to practice your inner strength.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.400
Sit down and let me talk to you.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.190
I do trust you.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.690
But Yu'er told me

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.240
that last night you said,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.500
"Visiting courtesans

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.950
is a common thing for a real man."

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.830
I said so many

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.120
righteous things last night.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.430
Why did you only tell Mr. Chang

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.380
this one sentence?

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.640
Did he really say that?

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.240
If you don't speak up,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.900
no one will think you're mute.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.990
A grown son makes his own decisions.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.660
No, Mother,

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.850
you talk, and I'll listen.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.290
Although you don't hold
any official position,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.240
we are now

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.430
staying at
the Viceroy of Liangjiang's post station.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.510
All of this is true.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.230
I don't know many characters,

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.409
but I've lived long enough

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.870
to have learned

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.320
a thing or two about life.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.840
Look at the opera stage.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.800
Those little spirits and soldiers

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.950
doing somersaults and handstands

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.080
put on a lively show.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.240
But look again,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.860
the emperor,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.830
the prime minister,

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.490
and the generals on stage.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.480
Which one of them is doing somersaults

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.480
or handstands?

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.940
There's a principle here.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.520
What clothes you wear

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.750
and what position you hold

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.560
determine what you should do.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.830
If you can't understand
even this basic point,

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.030
you seem not to value your life anymore.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.270
Yes.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.830
You're right.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:19.950
I know.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.480
You're not a fool.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.070
You wouldn't start drinking
and visiting brothels

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.930
as soon as you set foot in Nanjing.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.370
I don't believe it.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.290
Yu'er doesn't believe it either.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.630
What do the viceroys

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.330
want from you?

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.320
What do they see in you?

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.120
Simply that you have no backing,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.370
and you have talent.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.320
So they can use you as their tool.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.890
But they are real high officials.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.870
Even if you help them make Nanjing

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.790
prosperous and magnificent,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.960
if just one person says

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.840
that they, as high officials,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.330
drink and visit brothels,

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.640
and if the emperor blames them,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.360
they'll need to find a scapegoat

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.510
to deal with the situation.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.110
Which scapegoat do you think

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.880
would be the most suitable one?

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.100
Then that would be so despicable of them.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.470
Pingyuan,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.800
I'll just say one thing.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.120
Your mother's wisdom far exceeds yours.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.790
Last night,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.900
Mr. Chang and I couldn't sleep at all.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.540
We were tossing and turning in bed,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.030
trying to figure out
how to get you out of this mess.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.720
I know.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.370
You want to save the world,

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.760
but you can't even save yourself.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.630
Who do you think you can possibly save?

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.230
You've dragged us into this.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.580
You've made your mother sick with worry.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.520
Aren't these your fault?

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.580
I didn't think it through.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.260
Mother, you're right.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.440
You always

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.240
rush headlong into things,

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.570
with that stubborn personality of yours.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:57.950
If you harm yourself,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.480
you'll end up dragging Yu'er

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.340
down with you.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.710
How could I bear that?

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.900
Mother,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.380
you're so farsighted.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.120
You

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.210
don't need to be so modest.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.270
Such a brilliant plan

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.670
is something

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.090
few people in this world could devise.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.200
However, these tactics

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.910
may work in business,

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.380
but in the official circles,

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.200
they're far too dangerous.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.120
You are

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.510
too conspicuous.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.120
As they say, the nail that sticks out
gets hammered down.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.660
When the time truly comes

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
for execution,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.600
exile, or confiscation of property,

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.330
it will be too late for regrets.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.390
Stop frightening him.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.530
Go about your business.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.910
Be it beheading, exile,
or property confiscation,

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.840
I'll be with you.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:45.910
If you restrict him

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:46.840
from making any move,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.750
he'll just stay at home every day

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.600
watching me embroider.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.530
I won't stand it.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.350
It's a good thing

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.480
he knows now.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.160
[Liangjiang Viceroy's Office]

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.200
These are banknotes
from the Four Major Banks.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.460
They have no markings.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.670
Each is worth 10,000 taels.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.200
They can be cashed anywhere.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.580
200,000 taels in total.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.200
Please accept them.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.700
My good nephew,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.490
this money

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.360
is truly a great help to me.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.610
This money is nothing.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.870
If it can solve

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.390
your urgent problem,

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.600
I will feel much relieved.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.720
And my matter

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.210
will naturally be easier to resolve.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.750
Today, I've received
from benevolent merchant Li Qin

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.720
a donation of

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.480
200,000 taels of silver.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.660
This is the receipt
from the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.000
[Donated by Jiangning]

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.460
It bears my official seal.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.390
When I report to His Highness,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.040
there will surely be imperial rewards.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.670
For rebuilding Nanjing,

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.960
all merchants who donate

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.630
will have their names
carved on stone tablets

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.150
placed at the entrance
of the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.050
This is an enormous merit indeed.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:11:59.880
Uncle,

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.910
my father instructed

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.910
that no receipt
is necessary for this money.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:03.700
No, no.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.670
This is money for Nanjing.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:15.770
Uncle,

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.930
you truly are

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.440
the renowned Neo-Confucian master,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.900
as clean and pure as water,

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.960
with impeccable integrity.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.070
I admire you greatly.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.510
As clean and pure as water,

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.110
with impeccable integrity?

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.720
I'm not so sure.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.290
When you say these things,

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.080
you must mean what you say.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.670
I speak these words

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:36.810
not to flatter you.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.410
I hope you understand.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.130
A few days ago,

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.120
I heard you went with that brother

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.320
of mine, surnamed Gu,

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.840
to drink by the Qinhuai River.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.270
You've devoted your life
to Neo-Confucianism,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.270
yet could tarnish your reputation.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.850
I'm sure the imperial court

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.600
will understand your difficulties.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.050
I never expected

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.600
that Li Million would have

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.080
such a fine son.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.150
I'm truly envious.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.210
You're certainly no ordinary person.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.390
You've seen these little schemes of mine

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.280
through quite clearly.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:13.170
Not at all.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.790
Uncle, you are half a sage.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.600
Until death,

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.690
I must practice virtue with caution.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.670
Do you think

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.720
being a sage is so easy?

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.200
I understand.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.320
I'm very cautious myself.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.320
About my matter...

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.120
In Nanjing now,

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.720
nothing can be done.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.680
The army can't be disbanded.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.740
The soldiers become disgruntled,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.480
and discipline breaks down.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.620
If trouble breaks out someday,

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.180
that would be disastrous.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.550
Years of hard work

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.720
will be ruined in an instant.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.480
Uncle,

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.270
there's already a solution at hand.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:53.320
Look.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.270
These

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.270
are the title deeds for salt fields

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:56.330
and management rights to salt stores,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.480

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.670
when he was doing business with others.

[Li Million shall have
10 and a half shares.]

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.550
Now that peace has returned,

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.550
you should give us instructions

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.080
on how to proceed with them.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.550
I'll follow your orders.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.240
If this matter is settled,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.100
that small amount of money for you

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.500
is certainly nothing.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.110
Can Li Million handle

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.000
all these businesses?

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.480
Doesn't he find it exhausting?

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.340
When my father's business grows,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.910
helping you with your affairs

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.770
will make us stand even stronger.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.120
Your Excellency.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.450
Where did you go this morning?

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.690
I just delivered an elegiac couplet.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:55.990
At the madam's grave,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.050
I cried a bit.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.200
You didn't even know her.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.660
How could you possibly cry?

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.960
Well, Your Excellency,
you wrote the elegiac couplet.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.870
I just shed a few tears.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.000
Consider it a complimentary service.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.790
Besides,

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.720
I was genuinely moved.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:07.830
Moved by what?

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.150
She was old enough

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.510
to be your mother.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.000
You're so kind

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.630
to give me all the credit.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.150
Yesterday,

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.200
half the girls from the brothels

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.480
all rushed to my house.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.310
It made my mother so angry

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.940
that she told everyone to ignore me.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.870
My wife directly

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.080
banished me to sleep
in the hall for the night.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.080
I'm toiling for our country,

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.720
which is one thing,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.580
but to end up with such a result...

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.720
When I think about it,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.200
I feel so wronged.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.520
You set me up,

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.080
so I had to get back at you.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.320
Alright,

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.810
I'll write a letter soon

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.000
to explain everything clearly.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.340
I'll tell your mother

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.600
it was official business.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.460
Don't feel wronged because of me.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.670
But my mother also said

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.600
if it's truly for the benefit
of Jiangnan's people,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.860
then it's acceptable.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.210
As long as you

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.240
can ensure my family's safety,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.600
I'm willing to sacrifice myself completely

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.800
without hesitation.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:02.840
Of course.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.050
Confucius said,

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.410
"How do we know the future
won't be better than the present?"

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.460
[1,000 taels]

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.600
Li Qin

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.720
has delivered 200,000 taels of silver.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.630
I'm thinking

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.270
of allocating 100,000 taels

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.670
to the Jinling Publishing House

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.360
to ensure the "Complete Library
of the Four Treasuries"

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.560
is properly printed.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.390
As for the remaining 100,000 taels,

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:30.510
I'll keep 30,000 to 50,000

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.790
to renovate the Qinhuai River

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:32.720
by widening the waterway,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.720
dredging it, and repairing buildings.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.240
The money that's left

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.390
will be used to repair examination halls

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.460
and fix roads.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.000
As you mentioned,
the way of pen and sword demands

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.960
a balance between tension and relaxation.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.560
That's what it means, right?

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.360
You're brilliant, Your Excellency.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.550
I'll definitely keep a close eye on

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.570
the Jinling Publishing House.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.680
I plan to—

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.510
Wait, wait.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.950
Don't try to avoid work.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:52.390
No,

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.850
how is this avoiding work?

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.550
Proofreading catalogs.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.480
Comparing editions.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.790
It's an important task.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.790
This isn't something you need to do.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.000
There are plenty of idle scholars around.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.200
Don't worry about it.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.069
Let me ask you.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.329
Do you understand salt administration?

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.119
Not at all.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.810
You can learn if you don't.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.750
Before you came, I heard

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.470
that you were excellent at selling tea.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.270
A master in that field.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.550
How hard could it be
to understand salt administration?

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.859
This Li Million,

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.680
using the military expense
reimbursement issue,

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.010
wants me to support him.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.750
He spent several years

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.349
and has actually managed

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:28.920
to get all of Jiangnan's salt stores

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.510
and salt fields

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.200
under his control.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.790
He's forcing me

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:33.570
to approve it.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.980
Isn't this equivalent
to putting all the nation's taxes

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.640
into

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.880
his hands?

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.920
How dangerous!

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.390
But this Li Million

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.000
really has an eye for business.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.550
Impressive.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.550
Very impressive.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.550
Why?

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.340
Are you scared?

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.610
The state has always used salt licenses

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.670
as monopoly rights

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.640
given to salt merchants.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.160
They pay taxes every year.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:00.860
In the past,

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.180
this was a good method.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.290
But after years of peace,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.160
these salt merchants
have become extremely greedy.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.030
They just appease the imperial court

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.000
while raising prices as they please.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.310
In provinces affected by war,

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.570
salt prices are higher than rice prices.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:15.820
In my opinion,

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.640
we shouldn't hand these things

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.310
over to him.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.750
The people's money
should be earned by the people.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.810
The state shouldn't create a monster

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.760
that devours everything in sight.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.440
Your Excellency.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.160
If it's about capital

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.310
or ability,

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.070
I'm truly no match

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.930
for Li Million.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.070
I appreciate your favor,

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.070
but I really

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.770
can't handle this matter.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.400
Desertion in the face of duty

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.000
is punishable by death.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.030
I know

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.320
you two are old acquaintances.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.500
If you handle this matter well for me,

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.030
I'll grant you an official rank.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.420
Well...

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.510
If you fail,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.800
military law will deal with you.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.400
[Righteous and Diligent]

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.800
Please, no formalities.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.130
Let's go through things one by one.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:31.270
[Righteous and Diligent]

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.960
Now,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.920
Westerners from over a dozen countries

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.070
have sent official documents
to Liangjiang.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.720
First,

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.000
they demand the restoration
of their churches.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Second,

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.320
they want to conduct business here.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.140
Ever since the "Treaty of Nanjing"
was signed,

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:45.200
[Righteous and Diligent]

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.060
all countries have demanded
equal trading rights.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.590
This is a massive change

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.190
unprecedented
in our thousand-year history.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:53.770
No one knows

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
what we should do.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.680
Which of you has experience

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.740
in foreign affairs

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.840
and can negotiate with them?

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.440
Your Excellency.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.720
I'd like to try.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.440
Mr. Li.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.650
Your family has done business
with Westerners before.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.450
But Mr. Gu has experience too.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.000
Why don't you two

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.350
take on this matter together,

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.010
so you can support each other?

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.350
Yes.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.980
Yes.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.480
The main principle lies in

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.450
equal treatment
and upholding proper dignity.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.570
Please instruct me, Your Excellency.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.350
When dealing with them,

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.880
you can't use that superior attitude

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.830
of the Celestial Empire

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.850
or be arrogant.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.880
Their ironclad warships and cannons

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.120
are not just for show.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.020
But there's no need to fear them blindly.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.150
Reasonable matters

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.960
must be handled properly.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.160
As for doing business...

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.270
When trading in Liangjiang,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.060
I have just one rule

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.040
for you

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.310
that you must win;

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.720
losing is not an option.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.510
Set boundaries for them.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.000
Don't let them do as they please.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:06.780
Li Qin,

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.590
since you're an imperial court
candidate intendant,

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:09.550
you should wear your official robes.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:09.920
Yes.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.790
[Righteous and Diligent]

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.190
As for the second matter,

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.440
the imperial court has issued an edict

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.570
to restore the salt and iron monopoly.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.540
Most of the national tax revenue

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.960
comes from salt administration.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.060
So we need to quickly calculate,

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.530
in the Jiangnan region,

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.470
whether these salt fields have title deeds

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.720
and their owners are still alive

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.760
and how many salt stores there are.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.790
Currently
in the Seven Provinces of Jiangnan,

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.590
salt is more expensive than rice.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.520
This is absolutely unacceptable.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.230
Except for these two,

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.880
the rest of you go immediately

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.680
and form groups

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.480
to investigate the situation

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.480
in each province and county.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.940
Don't delay the imperial court's business.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.000
Yes.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.160
has walls that are like glass.

Who knows how many eyes

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.400
are watching you?

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.260
Do you realize?

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.100
That old fox wants us
to fight like roosters.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.240
He wants us to fight to the death.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.510
And when we're both exhausted,

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.350
he'll be even less likely

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.810
to give up the salt fields.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.060
You have shops and title deeds,

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.310
all purchased with your hard-earned money.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.570
What are you afraid of?

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.920
If the imperial court were reasonable,

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.790
I wouldn't be afraid at all.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.270
But the problem is they're not reasonable.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.530
These papers in my hand

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.750
are no different

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:30.880
from a pile of trash.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.590
This place

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:34.880
is far too dangerous.

You really shouldn't get involved here.

this cockfight now.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.000
We need to come up with a plan.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.310
We can't let that old man

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.370
play us like fools.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.150
I hope you're telling the truth.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:58.200
Look,

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.720
that old guy is quite something.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.400
We haven't even entered
the cockfighting arena yet,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.860
and we're already
suspicious of each other.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:10.360
Exactly.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.270
According to the "Treaty of Nanjing"

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.790
and the "Treaty of Wangxia,"

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.480
we believe

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.550
that in an open commercial framework,

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.790
all nations
should receive equal treatment.

there's no way
to further deepen our relationship.

for both parties.

Yeah.

the Spinning Jenny.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.720
It was invented in Lancashire, England

by James Hargreaves

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.930

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.880
It marks the magnificent beginning

of the Industrial Revolution.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.070
This machine can simultaneously

spin 80 spindles.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.510
After numerous modifications,

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.030
it now runs on steam power.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:17.640
Well, we have this kind of machine

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.510

Currently in Cape Town,

there are 300 textile factories.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.610
It's not just a machine.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.300
It's a monster.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.340
Believe me,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.190
all the silk in China

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.960
can't satisfy its appetite.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.430
The fabric it produces

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640
is high-density,

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.440
inexpensive,

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.410
and beautiful.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.370
Does that mean

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.970
when this monster comes in,

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.400
all silk workers
in the Seven Provinces of Jiangnan

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.380
will starve?

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.160
Okay.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.110
Don't have to worry about.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.590
We need a lot of workers.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.680
He says they can come

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.520
to work for us.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.680
We also have pharmaceutical, printing,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.350
manufacturing, and metallurgy industries.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.720
We need a large workforce.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.850
This is outrageous!

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.830
Is this what you call
a business negotiation?

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.790
You claim you need business equality

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:11.510
and free trade.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:12.640
What is this really?

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.080
Destroying Chinese factories

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.160
and buying Chinese people

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.020
as cheap labor?

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.720
Getting angry with them won't help.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.070
Viceroy's Office

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.830
has no solution.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.200
That's why they passed the buck to us.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.660
If we just leave like this,

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.880
will they have any solution?

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.400
Okay.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.070
And what's your final word

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.310
of this negotiation?

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.160
Please give us

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.030
a final answer.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.720
Because this

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.120
is the last negotiation.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.570
I can give him an answer right away.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.520
But I need to confirm one thing.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.070
As for so-called equal opportunity,

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.680
does it mean our merchants

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.200
can be fully permitted

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.350
to go to your country to do business?

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.070
Since we have equal opportunities,

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.310
does that mean

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.240
they can also

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.270
do business in your country as well?

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.550
You're welcome

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.200
in London,

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.200
Washington,

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.730
and the African colonies.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.440
He says you're welcome to go to London,

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.170
Washington,

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.030
and their colonies

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.350
all over Africa.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.350
The opportunities are equal.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.100
God will always give money

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.560
to the greediest people.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.590
Tell them to spare us this nonsense.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.340
No need to translate this.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.810
I want to clarify one more thing.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:22.790
What if these industries

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.050
they want to operate in

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.680
have no business opportunities left

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.790
in our country?

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.350
You are officials.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.210
You're not businesspeople then.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:35.940
He says

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.240
you are officials, not merchants.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.160
Tell him

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.240
these two people before him

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.570
are not officials at all

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.380
but genuine merchants
from the Qing Empire.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.130
The silk industry,

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.510
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.830
and the tea industry they want

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:51.640
have no room

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.000
for further investment

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.270
in our country.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.920
Even if Jiangnan makes an exception,

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.520
in the end,

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.130
they'll still return empty-handed.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.920
You go ahead. Come on.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.960
I'm so angry at them,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.980
you know?

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.370
Can this be called a negotiation?

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:17.110
Isn't this just

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:18.310
a routine notification to us?

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.160
It's like a robber

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:19.640
telling us

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.070
if they can take some money to spend!

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.270
Isn't that the point?

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.400
I want to...

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.800
I want to shoot them dead.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.350
Let's go. Let's go.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.830
Let's go back and discuss.

No, help me walk.

In the 22nd year
of the Daoguang reign (1842),

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.920
the 13 Trading Houses were abolished.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.160
The country's doors were thrown open

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.030
with Westerners rushing in for profit.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.310
Western merchants are backed by gunboats,

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.910
like wolves wanting to devour
our Qing Empire.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.400
If these Westerners open their factories,

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.880
all the weavers
in the Seven Provinces of Jiangnan

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.920
will be ruined.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.030
They'll all have to go

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.280
to their factories

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.050
and become their slaves.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.070
With our large population,

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.750
how could everyone willingly

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:57.950
become their slaves?

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.850
Have you seen these photos before?

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.070
What's the point of
whether I've seen them or not?

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.920
If these words are said

to those officials in the capital,

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.790

"You only value frivolous skills."

after all.

After all these years,

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.970
nothing has changed at all.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.040
You're right.

Look at these viceroys in Jiangnan.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.050
Who would talk about this?

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.260
They all stick to Neo-Confucianism
as it's the safest.

I'm a businessman.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.130
The quickest way

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.610
is to spend money

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.810
to buy the machines

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.270
and set up factories.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.740
At worst, I'll spend more money

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.240
to hire foreign technicians

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:47.900

Don't say such things in my house.

what will we do then?

a Westerner had come in.

Everyone.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.200
In the past,
power belonged to the imperial court.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.920
Back then,

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.300
we could do business without any effort.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.110
But after so many years of war,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:42.960
do you still think

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.750
the power remains with the imperial court?

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.070
If you think that way,

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.830
within 3 years,

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:49.830
every one of you

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.500
will have to pack up and leave.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.590
When I went over there and saw it,

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.390
we had already

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.440
been outflanked by Westerners.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:58.810
The Westerners...

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.380
The Westerners in Darjeeling

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.880
have planted hundreds of thousands
of acres of green tea.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.680
The seedlings

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.000
were stolen from us.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.380
I was completely shocked.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.710
And over there,

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.070
they don't care about pre-Qingming picking

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.340
or roasting at all.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.230
They just dry fresh leaves

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.850
in the sun

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.050
and give them a quick bake.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.160
That's not so bad.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.890
What do you mean by "not so bad"?

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.720
Do you know

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.060
the Westerners

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.150
brew tea with hot milk?

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.090
They even add sugar

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:30.440
and rose petals.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.170
It made my mouth so sour

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.460
I couldn't even tell what I was drinking.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:35.920
But

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.510
Indian tea is cheap

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.350
and sold in large quantities.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.550
The Westerners prefer their products.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:44.590
If you ask me,

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.730
we need to find another way.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.240
The war just ended,

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.370
and the Westerners want
to take over the tea, silk,

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:51.830
and medicine businesses.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.030
The Liangjiang government

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.960
wants us to fight a commercial battle

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.270
against Westerners
on Liangjiang territory.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.330
They say we must win

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.540
and can't lose.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.350
What does that mean?

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.640
What they are doing now

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.680
is buying in bulk

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.630
and driving prices down.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.070
Do you know?

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.550
Today at the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office,

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.110
I was looking through the accounts.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.310
Their foreign agents

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.440
have bought up 70-80% of cocoons

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.969
from Lianghu, Liangguang,

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.010
and East and West Zhejiang.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.630
Do you understand

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.690
what 70-80% means?

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:27.840
So many.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.370
They're making such a big move

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.110
just to set their own prices.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.150
If in the future,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.770
tea, silk, and medicine

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.760
are all priced by Westerners,

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.760
how is that any different

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.260
from generals surrendering our territory?

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.070
That's why I say we're in imminent danger.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.710
The crisis is upon us.

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:48.420
This is no joking matter.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.840
You mean

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.880
the imperial court is in imminent danger?

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.090
It's the entire country

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.490
that's in imminent danger.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.620
I hold no love for this regime,

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.970
but my heart belongs to this land.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.400
Whenever I see

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.480
those Westerners' spinning machines

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.540
and steam engines,

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.030
I feel deeply alarmed.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.610
One of their spinning machines

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.360
is equal to 80 of our weavers.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.840
Their efficiency
is more than 10 times ours.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.300
Powered by steam engines,

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:28.360
they can operate year-round,

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.790
day and night without stopping.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:30.530
You know,

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.070
for Westerners
to build factories in China,

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.730
the costs are incredibly low.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.090
In the future, our workers

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:37.880
will be

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.710
slaves in their factories

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.040
for their entire lives,

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.030
or

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.110
there will be

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:45.610
an even greater disaster.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.770
This is just the textile industry.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.710
As for all the others,

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:52.690
I dare not imagine.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.030
Mr. Gu,

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.800
you truly haven't

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.660
wasted your time in officialdom.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.840
Every word shows your concern
for our country and people.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.240
You make me feel ashamed.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.280
When I was growing tea in Anhui before,

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.480
I was still fighting with the head
of the Tea Merchants' Association,

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.920
squabbling among ourselves.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:12.840
Back then, I thought

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.760
I was so clever.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:15.190
But when I went to Jiangning,

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:16.030
in less than 10 days,

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:17.550
I felt completely inadequate.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.880
The French, the British,

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.880
and the Portuguese

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.070
mobilize their entire nations

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.330
to do business with us,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.030
using the most advanced technology,

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.360
the finest weapons,

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.040
and the toughest attitudes.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:29.590
What do they want?

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.080
They want to hollow out the Qing Empire.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:34.710
And what about us?

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.800
We're still in a daze,

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.150
not taking them seriously,

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.670
fantasizing the Qing Empire,

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:39.880
and looking down on everything.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.030
There is no future.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.670
There are no draft banks anymore.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.230
And there's no Li Million anymore.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.640
Can't you see?

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.690
They're now using guns and cannons

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.170
to force us into business.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.820
Either we lose, or we win.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.230
There's no room

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:53.980
for benevolence and morality.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:57.070
The Jiangnan region

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.710
hasn't yet recovered its strength.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.770
There are many Westerners there too.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.840
Whether we can survive in the future

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:06.480
depends on whether we can establish
ourselves in the south.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.550
I've taken over

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.630
all the salt industry in Lianghuai.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:10.360
Next,

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:11.630
I'll monopolize

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.360
tea, silk,

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.480
and medicinal materials.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.680
When that time comes,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.360
I'll need suppot
from the Four Major Banks.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.670
If you invest more,

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.820
you'll get more profit in the future.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.550
Isn't it nice to count money at home?

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:28.400
Master Li.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.180
How many salt fields

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.510
have you acquired in Lianghuai?

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:34.590
142.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.170
I've been quietly taking them over

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:39.510
while having to guard against

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:42.760
the viceroys and governors
of Liangjiang undermining me.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.220
In the future,
when I need to mobilize funds,

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:46.320
my old friends,

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.520
you'll need to continue supporting me.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.550
The Four Major Banks can support you.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.760
However,

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.630
as for the profits from your salt fields,

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.200
the Four Major Banks

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.830
will take at least 30% in the future.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.800
Everyone's in it for the money.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.060
I think this deal works for me.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.110
Great.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:13.880
Mr. Li.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.890
We are just merchants.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.030
We can't make decisions

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:18.360
for the imperial court.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.880
But I think

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.480
at this moment,

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.480
we can join forces to save the market

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.230
and delay the Westerners' entry

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:26.510
into the Qing Empire.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.310
As for other matters,

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.290
we'll have to leave them

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.170
to more capable people.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.760
Good.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.360
Great.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.630
When you decide to act,
we'll act together.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.230
Gu,

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:47.800
why do I feel so uncomfortable

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.800
in your house?

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:50.070
I...

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:54.810
I feel like I'm being watched.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.120
What are you all doing?

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:05.960
If you want to look,

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.420
come in and look properly.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.470
My friend Mr. Li

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.550
has just returned from India

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:11.670
after selling tea there.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.230
Are you not used to his appearance?

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.030
I think he looks quite handsome.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.440
Fine, look then.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:19.710
What do you think?

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.520
Isn't it quite special?

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.330
Who would dress like this?

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.730
Looks like a long-legged chicken.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.650
Westerners' knees don't bend.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:30.130
Hit them with a stick,

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.320
and they fall to the ground.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.740
Who told you that, old man?

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:33.550
Why are you wearing

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.880
a spittoon on your head?

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.230
Alright, that's enough.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.770
Move along, move along.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:37.590
Nothing to see here.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.120
Fine, everyone, disperse.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.490
I want one of those too.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:43.730
Go away, all of you.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.580
Mother,

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:46.800
why are you here too?

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.010
Old Madam Gu.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:49.360
You're here.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:51.270
Do you need anything?

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.440
They were all gathered at the door.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.440
I didn't see that.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.280
I'm fine.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.160
Y-You continue talking.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.030
In recent years,
there's been fighting in the south.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.320
Rebels often take stones
from the coastal embankment

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.070
to build their fortifications,

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:14.000
causing severe damage to many sections
of the coastal embankment.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.600
With the treasury depleted,

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.960
the coastal embankment
has gone unrepaired for years.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.000
I got reports yesterday—
Nantong's coastal embankment collapsed,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.320
causing countless casualties.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.190
We're currently calculating
the number of victims

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.440
and the taels of silver and food

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.630
needed for disaster relief.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.150
We can't count on

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.320
the imperial court anymore.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.780
We need to find a solution.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.510
Your Excellency.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.630
The Li family is willing to help you.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.150
Before I came, my father instructed me

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.080
to serve you in every way possible.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.330
If you agree,

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.150
I can return to the capital immediately

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:49.070
to raise funds

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.000
to repair the coastal embankment.
What do you think?

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.800
Your intentions are admirable.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:54.510
But there's one thing.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:57.000
I don't do business blindly.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.110
After repairing the coastal embankment,

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.570
what do you want in return?

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:03.800
I submitted a list to you.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.230
The list of over 140 salt fields

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.960
in Jiangnan.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.920
If you can help me

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.090
settle this matter,

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.610
it'll be more convenient
to access funds in the future.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.350
Well, well.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:16.090
That...

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:18.280
That's quite a blunt statement.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.550
Why would the salt fields and stores

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:22.950
your Li family purchased

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.480
require the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:26.470
to intervene?

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.660
For some,

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.510
we can find the original owners.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.800
But there are others

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.360
that have been seized

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:34.710
by local bullies.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:35.960
And for some,

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.880
we only have the title deeds,

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:39.110
but the people who could claim them

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.150
are all dead.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:41.940
My father said

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.360
if the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.240
could lend a hand to the Li family,

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:47.960
we would certainly
do everything in our power

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.630
to serve you in the future.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.870
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.300
This isn't like you.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:59.280
Your Excellency,

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.480
I know nothing about the salt business.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:07.630
The salt industry
is a government monopoly.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:08.630
If this power

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:10.320
is placed in the hands of merchants,

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.030
it will inevitably weaken
the court's authority,

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.290
which is not good for the imperial court.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.510
How about this?

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.360
Why don't you two

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.840
both go repair the coastal embankment?

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.950
Split it into east and west sections.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:23.550
Each of you repairs one part.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.320
Then I'll judge which is better.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.360
After the repairs are done,

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.360
I'll request recognition
for your achievements

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.960
and mention the salt field matter
in my report.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.400
If you win, Mr. Li,

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.630
then the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office
will be duty-bound

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.800
to step in

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.760
and resolve this matter for you.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.760
Your Excellency,

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:42.440
I don't understand
what repairing the embankment

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.100
has to do with the salt fields.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.150
My good nephew,

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:47.590
you have no idea how much pressure

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:48.550
I'm under.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.480
Everyone thinks I've made

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.400
a fortune in this position.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:53.960
If I were to oversee

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.110
giving the Lianghuai salt business

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:56.280
to your family,

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.150
those memorials against me behind my back

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.760
would be piled higher than the city walls.
