Your Highness, spare my life.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.320
Please overlook my faults.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.420
I was blind to what I did.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.440
Just treat me like a fart and let me go.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.360
OK?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.550
From the moment you kidnapped her,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.150
you deserved to die.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.480
Your Highness,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.070
this woman has deceived you.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.110
She is not Su Qingran.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.670
I'm helping you.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.040
I decide what's true or false.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.440
What does it matter to you?

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.110
He knew all along
that my identity was fake.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.440
Your Highness,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.800
weren't you investigating
the case of gunpowder?

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800
I'll tell you everything.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.840
The gunpowder is hidden
in the secret room of Begonia House.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.630
I've told you everything I know.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.190
I can even testify for you.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.590
Together, we can expose Su Guang.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.360
You shouldn't have hurt her.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.440
Your Highness, please spare my life.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.980
Your Highness.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.880
Your Highness.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.630
Does it hurt?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.040
How could it not hurt?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.550
It's all because of me,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.150
that you got injured.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.400
You can ask me one question now.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.920
No matter what it is, I'll answer.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.230
But only one.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.230
How can I stop you from crying?

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.800
That's all you want to ask?

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.550
You've known all along I am not...

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.320

Get to the point.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.300
Reporting, My Lord,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.400
the secret room is empty.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.670
Wen Yueqian, oh Wen Yueqian,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.880
you acted rashly.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.960
Wanyan Lie holds a blood feud
with my father.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.520
Wanyan Qi harmed you, killed you,
and used you.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.950
You and Prince Zhenbei's Mansion
are mortal enemies.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.040
How could you fall for Wanyan Jin?

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.270
Father.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.070
You may leave now.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.520
The crown prince did go
to Begonia House,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.000
and searched the secret room.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.190
Luckily, you moved the gunpowder
in advance.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.710
That's thanks to your wise guidance.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.590
That foolish Ye Changyuan,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.360
I told him to prepare well
for the next trade.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.360
But he actually kidnapped Su Qingran.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.320
He truly deserves to perish.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.670
I just don't know

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.000
what Ye Changyuan told Qingran
and the crown prince.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.920
Smuggling gunpowder is a grave matter.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.880
Now both Qingran and the crown prince
know about the gunpowder.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.360
The crown prince pursued
even more relentlessly.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.250
It's only a matter of time
before he uncovers the truth.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.670
Wanyan Jin is highly favored
by Wanyan Lie.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.360
He can't be killed.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.630
Killing Wanyan Jin is too risky.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.000
How about

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.070
we start with Qingran?

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.520
If Qingran goes missing,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.270
the crown prince will surely
be distracted.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.880
At the right time,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.750
I will have Wanyan Qi
take over this matter.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.040
That way,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.750
the control over this matter

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.840
will ultimately return to our hands.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.920
It's just that

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.840
we're treating Qingran like this,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.400
you wouldn't mind, would you?

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.630
You're

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.360

Father, for what reason have you
specially prepared a banquet

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.840
and invited me here today?

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.920
Nothing much.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.400
I just want to have a meal with you.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.960
Yes, Father has been
thinking of you lately.

Father,

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.110
you haven't drugged me, have you?

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.110
Of course not.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.400
You are my daughter, after all.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.550
I don't like eating greens.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.630
Father, you eat it.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.480
Here.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.190

You still defend your cruel father.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.750
