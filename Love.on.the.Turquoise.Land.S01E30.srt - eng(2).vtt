00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:50.017

00:03:28.232 --> 00:03:29.313

00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:55.881
to come back safe.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.602
I will bring her back.

00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:01.393
I definitely will.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.504
(Nanshan Rescue Team)

00:04:19.056 --> 00:04:20.368
(Entrusted by All, Aid from All Sides)

00:04:26.864 --> 00:04:32.048
(Entrusted by All, Aid from All Sides)

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:35.081
Are you sure it was her?

00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:36.561
It must be.

00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:38.680
Luo once told me

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.321
her mother died while repairing

00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:42.321
the Golden Gate.

00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:43.697
But no one ever found her body.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.081
Once enter the Twilight Chasm,

00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:50.761
no human can be alive.

00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:53.120
So, in the very beginning,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.761
whenever Hunters got wounded
by Earth Fiends,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.872
to prevent harming others
after transforming,

00:04:58.096 --> 00:04:59.800
they'd exile themselves
in the Golden Gate.

00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:02.720
We inherit this tradition.

00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:07.480
But the Hunters back then didn't realize

00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:09.600
that once those wounded by fiends

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.160
entered the Twilight Chasm,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.161
they would transform into something
neither human nor fiend.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.161
Earth Demons.

00:05:15.312 --> 00:05:18.000
They lose consciousness gradually,
and can only act on instinct.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.760
So Luo's mother is

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.400
a South Mountain Hunter
who exiled herself

00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:26.120
and has survived

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.281
as an Earth Demon.

00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:31.640
Survived as an Earth Demon?

00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:36.400
Luo is still alive.

00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:39.281
She might be protected

00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:41.120
by her mother somewhere
in the Twilight Chasm.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.441
Have you forgotten?

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.480
Back in the Twilight Chasm,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.161
Earth Demons

00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:46.640
attacked even us.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.240
No.

00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:50.640
I think they're different
from Earth Fiends.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.161
I saw her by the riverbank.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.240
She still had consciousness

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.600
and wanted to protect Luo.

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:03.161
I believe so.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.640
Check one more time.

00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:11.600
The Life-Death Blade, Ghost Whip,
Copper Hammer, War Ocarina.

00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:13.240
Don't worry. We have everything.

00:06:13.801 --> 00:06:15.161
Done your War Ocarina practice?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.321
Almost done.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.600
I practice according
to Ma Hanzi's old score.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.921
Let's hope it works.

00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:20.760
But what if...

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.760
No "what ifs".

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.700
Let's go.

00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:40.561
Put that down.

00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:47.480
You're Pei Ke,

00:10:48.041 --> 00:10:49.640
Luo's mother, right?

00:10:53.321 --> 00:10:54.480
Where is Luo?

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.801
Can you understand me?

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.681
I'm looking for Nie Jiuluo.

00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:02.000
Do you know where she is?

00:11:18.921 --> 00:11:21.400
Do you mean she fell into the river?

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.281
Pei Ke.

00:12:21.873 --> 00:12:22.833
The wind was so strong

00:12:22.954 --> 00:12:24.208
that it blew the window open.

00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:32.593
Luo's agent came today.

00:12:33.873 --> 00:12:36.154
He suspected something happened to Luo

00:12:36.234 --> 00:12:37.873
and made a scene here.

00:12:40.474 --> 00:12:41.273
I see.

00:12:42.873 --> 00:12:43.553
It's fine.

00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:45.434
At least besides us,

00:12:45.793 --> 00:12:47.033
someone else cares about her.

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:55.313
Take this.

00:12:57.328 --> 00:12:58.576
The password is your birthday.

00:13:01.873 --> 00:13:02.633
Tuo.

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:05.154
What do you mean?

00:13:06.234 --> 00:13:07.154
I don't know

00:13:07.994 --> 00:13:09.514
when I'll be back.

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:12.273
I bet you don't want to go back

00:13:12.714 --> 00:13:13.833
to the Roadsound house.

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:16.434
So live here peacefully.

00:13:18.313 --> 00:13:19.914
If you get bored, go out and have fun.

00:13:20.593 --> 00:13:21.754
Don't worry about anything.

00:13:24.833 --> 00:13:27.073
Be bold, be free.

00:13:28.154 --> 00:13:29.674
Don't live for anyone,

00:13:30.073 --> 00:13:31.273
only for yourself.

00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:40.714
You could go travel,

00:13:41.714 --> 00:13:42.553
study abroad,

00:13:43.474 --> 00:13:45.194
or invest in a business.

00:13:45.313 --> 00:13:45.914
Or you can...

00:13:45.914 --> 00:13:47.033
I won't go anywhere.

00:13:49.793 --> 00:13:51.194
I'll wait here for you.

00:14:14.736 --> 00:14:18.000
(No Signal)

00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:29.593
Even if Luo was still alive
when she fell into the water,

00:14:30.593 --> 00:14:31.833
it's been so long now,

00:14:32.674 --> 00:14:35.313
and the environment here...

00:14:38.474 --> 00:14:39.434
No offense.

00:14:40.353 --> 00:14:42.873
Just want you to be mentally prepared
for any situation.

00:14:46.033 --> 00:14:46.793
Actually,

00:14:48.394 --> 00:14:50.154
I'm not doing so only to save her,

00:14:50.896 --> 00:14:52.434
but also to get an answer for myself.

00:14:53.353 --> 00:14:54.553
Otherwise, I'll live

00:14:54.553 --> 00:14:56.273
in guilt and regret.

00:15:03.394 --> 00:15:04.714
Glad that you thought it through.

00:15:48.633 --> 00:15:49.633
Stay safe.

00:16:37.793 --> 00:16:38.633
Can you hear me?

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:41.434
Everything's normal.

00:17:15.754 --> 00:17:16.994
Monitor the oxygen supply.

00:17:17.754 --> 00:17:19.113
Don't descend too quickly.

00:17:36.553 --> 00:17:37.434
From my perspective,

00:17:38.608 --> 00:17:39.714
this scene looks like

00:17:39.714 --> 00:17:41.328
the ultrasound during prenatal checkups.

00:17:42.672 --> 00:17:44.208
Before I met Jiang,

00:17:44.944 --> 00:17:46.544
I interned in obstetrics and gynecology.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.353
In my very first year there,

00:17:51.033 --> 00:17:52.714
I saw a pregnant woman got miscarried.

00:17:53.793 --> 00:17:55.273
She kept blaming herself.

00:17:57.073 --> 00:17:58.113
No one can comfort her.

00:18:00.954 --> 00:18:01.633
She said

00:18:02.394 --> 00:18:04.873
children choose families
filled with love to be born into.

00:18:06.273 --> 00:18:07.514
Her child didn't come to her,

00:18:07.514 --> 00:18:09.648
because he noticed his parents
didn't love him enough.

00:18:10.914 --> 00:18:13.234
True parents

00:18:13.234 --> 00:18:14.914
are those who would sacrifice all

00:18:15.073 --> 00:18:16.633
for their child.

00:18:17.793 --> 00:18:19.514
This is why during childbirth,

00:18:19.994 --> 00:18:21.793
the mothers suffer
such excruciating pain.

00:18:44.553 --> 00:18:45.273
Wait.

00:18:46.474 --> 00:18:47.633
The temperature is rising.

00:18:48.073 --> 00:18:49.394
There's a heat source beneath.

00:18:53.553 --> 00:18:55.194
Might be a unique geological structure.

00:18:55.353 --> 00:18:56.674
It's hard to tell what it is.

00:18:56.954 --> 00:18:57.674
Come back now.

00:19:17.113 --> 00:19:18.474
There might be danger.

00:19:18.994 --> 00:19:20.234

Can any of you hear me?

00:19:44.553 --> 00:19:46.273
