00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.640
Hello.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.660
Um...

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.790
Can I add you on WeChat?

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.870
Sorry.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.950
I don't use WeChat.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.030
What about your phone number?

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.390
No phone, either.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.460
TikTok, Taobao, Goofish,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.410
or your home address.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.422
Give her at least one.

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:04.866
Don't you already have all of those?

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:06.422
Are you giving those to others?

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:08.580
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?

00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:13.920
Why are you here at this hour?

00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:16.311
I'm waiting for someone.

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:17.466
Waiting for someone?

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.200
Me?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.990
I haven't seen you for days. Miss me?

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.440
You're both here.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.040
What took you so long?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.080
Bro,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.790
my car's restricted today.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.270
I couldn't get a cab.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.060
I took the subway, then the bus.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.640
I stood the whole way. I'm exhausted.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.230
Oh right.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.080
Do you have a tape measure?

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.320
I couldn't find one on the way.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.950
Yeah. What do you need it for?

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.670
Didn't you say

00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:46.710
you wanted to clear out the private room

00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:48.110
and get some small furniture?

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.710
Both of us are free

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.040
this afternoon.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.080
If you're free too,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.160
we can take the measurements first.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.110
Sure.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.990
Let's go upstairs.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.080
It was empty a few days ago.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.130
Maybe

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.320
they moved things in.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.730
But it's okay.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.488
I can move everything
to the storage room.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.660
They're not heavy.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.710
It won't take long.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.244
Let's move the things.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.290
If you need a tape measure,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.350
just tell me.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.950
Your self-control is pretty strong.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.350
Yours

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.510
isn't that strong.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.880
Hey, you guys...

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.270
You guys carry on.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.680
I'm leaving.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.370
I'll leave the thing

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.560
to you two.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.390
I'm busy.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.910
Thank you.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:03.390
Mr. Li,

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.590
I have a question.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.240
Regarding the installation
of these sensors...

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.100
I noticed most of the main structures

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.730
are already finished.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.490
We can embed

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.290
the equipment

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.020
into the floors, walls,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.080
and ceiling.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.490
The blueprints will have

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.733
all the detailed specifications.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.666
Once it's done,

00:06:19.688 --> 00:06:21.290
the whole neighborhood
can use the system

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.250
for high-efficiency

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.490
real-time control of lighting,

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.880
heating, and cooling.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.830
Good.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.560
See you.

00:06:27.955 --> 00:06:28.911
Thank you for your work.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.350
Hello?

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:54.390
Li Wu,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.120
are you busy?

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.250
I just met a client.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.680
I'm heading back to the office now.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.980
How's the financing

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.910
you mentioned before going?

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.800
The investor isn't very professional.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.810
I was thinking of convincing my partner

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.200
to try someone else.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.150
That's perfect.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.250
I'm in Jiandong

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.610
for an industry summit.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.930
I ran into a senior friend.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.540
He switched to investment.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.240
He focuses on AI environmental projects.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.100
I told him about your project.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.220
He's very interested

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.320
and wants to meet you.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.240
When are you free?

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.755
I'm free for the next couple of days.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.490
I'm meeting him later.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.270
Can you come over?

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.030
Sure.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:26.930
Okay.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:27.590
No problem.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.000
I'll send you the location.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.320
Bring all your documents.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.560
Okay.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.580
(Yashi Home Furniture, Welcome)

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.680
We're supposed to meet at 2 PM.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.350
It's 2:30 PM now.

00:08:18.266 --> 00:08:19.320
The proposal is pretty good.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.930
The data is solid,
and the perspective is forward-looking.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.290
Your planning and projections

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.355
are also very clear.

00:08:24.355 --> 00:08:25.610
I didn't expect someone so young

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.830
to have such vision.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.320
You flatter me.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.780
Since Shen is here today,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.340
we won't

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.320
beat around the bush.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.060
We've also

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.420
been talking to

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.750
a few other startups recently.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.980
They're

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.950
your competitors.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.530
See if

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.666
you can speed up the R&D.

00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:43.370
That way,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.777
I can move things forward sooner.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.520
Okay.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.320
I'll do my best.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.060
Looks like

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.160
he's pretty happy with you.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.230
Yiyang...

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.320
Stop.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.520
You're going to thank me again, right?

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.460
I've been telling you for years

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.470
that I'm not helping you
just to hear that.

00:09:01.377 --> 00:09:02.800
I'm also in the environmental field.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.580
I really think

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.870
your project is good,

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.844
and I want more people to know about it.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:07.870
Besides,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.440
it's also because of Cheng Rui.

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:14.088
Why are you staring at me?

00:09:14.155 --> 00:09:15.350
There's no code on my face.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.560
Let's have a meal together.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.040
Don't tell me you're
going to reject even this.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.860
(Something came up. I can't go to
the furniture store with you today.)

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:25.580
Oh no.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.750
My message didn't get through.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.990
So you're really saying no?

00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:29.340
I made plans with someone else.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.200
Next time.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.830
Okay. Take care on the way.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.470
Give it to me.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.355
You must've done a lot today.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.870
You're the one working harder, Mr. Shen.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.700
You're so busy

00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:03.044
that you don't pick up the phone,

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.770
but you still have time
to come to my bar.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.350
It's our great pleasure.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.350
I'm sorry.

00:10:07.577 --> 00:10:08.950
Something came up this afternoon.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.350
I sent you a message,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.080
but I only realized later

00:10:12.088 --> 00:10:13.177
that it didn't go through.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.040
No need to apologize.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.320
It's no biggie.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.440
I just got stood up. It's nothing.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.710
If you're tired, go rest.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.870
I'll handle the rest.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.200
I'm not tired.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.400
I'm still 300 steps away

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.230
from 20,000.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.400
Not tired at all.

00:10:58.422 --> 00:10:59.600
This alarm clock I bought

00:10:59.666 --> 00:11:00.777
is really useful.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.980
It reminds someone

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.080
not to waste time,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.460
especially

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.520
other people's time.

00:11:12.666 --> 00:11:13.711
What do you think?

00:11:13.755 --> 00:11:14.820
Can you see it clearly?

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.733
If it's not big enough,
I can get a bigger one.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:32.870
What is this?

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.400
You might be thirsty.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:35.990
Drink some water before you continue.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.340
You owe me a whole day.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.422
You have to pay it back.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:44.520
Okay.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.400
How?

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.700
Triple compensation.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.990
Seventy-two hours in total.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:48.750
Okay.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.950
I decide when it starts.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.320
Sure.

00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:54.370
Unless there's something special,

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.850
you can't turn down my request.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:56.750
Are you hungry?

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:57.560
Let's go.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.870
I'll treat you as an apology.

00:12:03.088 --> 00:12:04.320
I want something expensive.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.470
No problem.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.590
You came alone today?

00:12:09.266 --> 00:12:10.630
I didn't ask her to come with me.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.590
She has a meeting.

00:12:17.577 --> 00:12:19.590
Have you still been
getting headaches lately?

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:21.580
Any changes

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.590
after taking the medicine?

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.830
Much better.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.490
Even when I sleep late,

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:27.844
it doesn't hurt as much anymore.

00:12:27.866 --> 00:12:30.110
It's just that sometimes
I feel sleepy during the day.

00:12:32.022 --> 00:12:34.300
I mentioned earlier
that there can be some side effects.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.530
Sleepiness

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.200
is the most common one.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.060
But I suggest

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.110
you keep taking it.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.560
Compared to relieving the symptoms,

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:43.700
the side effects

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.080
are very minor.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:46.990
Alright.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.920
I'll adjust the dosage.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.520
Lower it a bit.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.520
If you feel anything

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.630
after you go back,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.950
let me know right away.

00:13:05.777 --> 00:13:07.190
You can go pick up your medicine now.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:07.990
Thank you.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:10.400
Li Wu.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.560
As a neurologist,

00:13:17.177 --> 00:13:18.555
I can only give you treatment

00:13:18.577 --> 00:13:19.844
on the medical side.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.080
But for certain psychological issues,

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.250
you'll need

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.040
a therapist.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.800
If you need one,

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.040
I can recommend someone.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.040
What do you mean?

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.920
It's very common advice.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.610
For neurology patients,

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.100
combining treatment with therapy

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:37.870
is common.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.470
Don't overthink it.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.400
Cen Jin

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.320
reaches out to me

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.590
and asks me to help you

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.420
because she hopes

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.590
you get better soon.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:56.470
Then

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.630
both of you can put down the burden

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.060
and go back

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.440
to your own lives.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.560
What burden?

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.680
What did she tell you?

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.710
Nothing much.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.470
But one thing is clear.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.160
She just wants you to get better.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:23.200
Thank you.

00:14:23.733 --> 00:14:25.244
But whatever's between me and her

00:14:25.311 --> 00:14:26.350
is none of your concern.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:28.990
I'll get going now.

00:14:56.355 --> 00:14:57.911
(How did the follow-up results look?)

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.370
I think

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.760
Lu Tong's idea is pretty good.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.160
We can build on that.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.250
What kind of smell

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.610
or environment

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.000
helps people sleep better?

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:26.920
I'll start.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.100
When I was little,

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.680
I slept in my grandma's arms,

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.220
and the smell of her osmanthus hair oil

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.590
made me sleep so soundly.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.520
That's heartwarming.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:36.630
I have one too.

00:15:36.955 --> 00:15:38.130
I fall asleep really easily

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.110
on trains,

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.990
especially the old green trains.

00:15:41.022 --> 00:15:42.666
The gentle swaying
puts me right to sleep.

00:15:42.666 --> 00:15:43.440
Like an iron cradle.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:44.990
Me too.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.220
Besides that,

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:46.980
I like sleeping

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.440
while holding my girlfriend.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.590
Her scent

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.710
makes me sleep really well.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.420
Didn't you just get a friend?

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:54.940
You also know it.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.300
Don't get me involved.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:56.980
Of course.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.710
Jin,

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.010
have you used this diffuser?

00:15:59.010 --> 00:15:59.870
How does it feel?

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.010
I always sleep well,

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:02.955
so I didn't use it.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.320
But I gave it to my brother.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:05.730
It worked great.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.490
He fell asleep in the time
it takes to cook noodles.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.350
Yeah, Jin.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.770
From a psychology perspective,

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.770
emotion, scent, and a sense of safety

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.110
are closely connected.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.710
We can keep going in this direction.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.100
Maybe interview

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.080
some people

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.010
and have them share

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.590
their memories about scents.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.180
Focus on the emotional part.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.080
It can be family, friendship,

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:26.870
or romance.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.370
That works.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.560
Here's your chance.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:30.950
Keep it short.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.060
The first time

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.100
I met my girlfriend,

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.200
her shampoo smelled...

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.230
I can't describe

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.770
how it smells.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.580
Maybe fruity.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.990
But for me...

00:16:41.044 --> 00:16:42.520
(Have you been using the diffuser?)

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.920
(Has your sleep improved
these past few days?)

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.020
(Send)

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.320
Everyone's busy?

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.590
I bought some supper.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.370
Take a break and eat something.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.890
Yi, you're so thoughtful.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.700
I was just about to
make instant noodles.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.110
I got you an extra-spicy one, Fatty.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.520
Thank you, Yi.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.700
Let's go.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:02.920
Thank you, Yi.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.590
Yi, come here.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.660
(Take meds)

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:45.380
(Take meds, Every day)

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:02.910
Mr. Yi.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.577
What's wrong?

00:18:05.666 --> 00:18:07.080
Why are you alone? Feeling down?

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:08.630
No.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.050
Mr. Li is like that.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.000
He likes things perfect.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.466
Don't take it to heart.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.870
I'm not.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.480
I just think

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:19.830
the schedule is too tight.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.733
Using a few small shortcuts

00:18:22.733 --> 00:18:24.080
won't affect the outcome.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:26.250
Sometimes finishing

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.888
is more important
than perfection, right?

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.350
I agree.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.350
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:18:34.244 --> 00:18:35.050
You're thinking about

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:36.150
our progress.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.560
Thank you, Mr. Yi.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.180
I normally

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.630
don't handle tech,

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.150
but I have a deep impression of you.

00:18:47.177 --> 00:18:48.390
I know you're very capable.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:49.660
You studied at Fudan

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.870
and Stanford.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.910
You're wasted

00:18:54.377 --> 00:18:55.320
in this company.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.560
No, no.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.040
Mr. Yi,

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.040
I didn't know

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.590
you paid attention to me.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.800
Mr. Yi, don't worry.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.320
I'll work harder.

00:19:06.911 --> 00:19:07.800
You can do this.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.350
Have some crayfish.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.090
The crayfish is really good.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.220
Sit. I'll get it for you.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.040
I can take it myself.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:18.810
Yi.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.110
Come join us, Yi.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.533
(Live stream notification)

00:19:54.540 --> 00:20:04.580
(No name set)

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.260
(Stray Cat)

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.380
(Welcome, Stray Cat,)

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.660
(to my stream.)

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.520
(Welcome.)

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.860
(When you're in the talking stage,)

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.720
(you two have your own secret codes.)

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.720
(Like...)

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.150
(When they ask,
"What are you doing?")

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.220
What they really mean is,

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.280
"I miss you."

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.420
In this situation,

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.110
don't reply with

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.380
"I'm working," "Getting off work,"

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.080
or "Going to eat."

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.280
(You can say...)

00:20:39.466 --> 00:20:41.350
("I'm eating something really good
by myself.)

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:42.870
(It's so good.)

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.190
(If there's a chance,)

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.280
(we can come together next time.")

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.390
(Then the conversation keeps going.)

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.140
(From their reply and attitude,)

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.220
(you'll know)

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.420
(where things)

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.560
(might go next.)

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.080
(What if they reply "Nothing much."?)

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.590
"Nothing much"?

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:06.770
(You can)

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.910
(cross them off the list.)

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:09.480
(First of all,)

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.870
(their EQ isn't great.)

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:12.870
(Think about it.)

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.250
(If you two get together,)

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.590
(and after some time,)

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.870
(you have nothing to talk about...)

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.190
(How boring would that be, right?)

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.630
(You can drop your thoughts)

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.000
(in the comments.)

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.060
(Chun Chang)

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.080
(What are you doing?)

00:21:37.666 --> 00:21:39.200
(I'm replying to your message.)

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.480
(That's so dry.)

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.630
(What about you?)

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.220
(Send)

00:21:57.444 --> 00:21:58.933
(Nothing much.)

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:04.480
("Nothing much"?)

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.380
(You can)

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.630
(cross them off the list.)

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.560
(I'm live streaming.)

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.430
(Trying to grow the account.)

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.111
(I need to hit my required hours.)

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.620
(If you're free, you can join)

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:18.888
(and help boost my ranking.)

00:22:23.644 --> 00:22:25.111
(I don't watch live streams.)

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:42.460
Excuse me.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.590
Can you take our order?

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:44.390
Okay.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.660
Have a look first.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:48.670
- Okay.
- Thanks.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.630
Here you go.

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:00.150
You came at the right time.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:01.430
I really need help now.

00:23:01.511 --> 00:23:02.380
I'll deduct the time

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.730
from your 72 hours.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.320
That table.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:05.150
Thanks.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.900
Why are you looking at me?

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.720
I'm here to chill as a customer.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.190
I'll let you do the work.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.140
Go on. They're waiting.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:18.670
You got this.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.280
You're back.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.040
Why are you so late?

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.000
The R&D

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.830
is at a critical stage.

00:23:38.044 --> 00:23:40.711
It's going to lock up
if you enter another wrong passcode.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:47.280
What's wrong?

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:50.870
Nothing.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.010
Nothing.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:53.870
I'm fine.

00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:55.760
You should go back.

00:23:56.044 --> 00:23:57.240
You've got another headache?

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.040
You look awful.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:01.770
Let me help.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:02.670
What's your door code?

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.280
Same as yours.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:40.430
It's okay.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.280
Here.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.430
Drink some water.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:17.630
Feel better now?

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:20.720
I'm fine.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:22.590
You should go.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.560
Where's your medicine?

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.390
I left it at the office.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.040
Why would you leave it there?

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:34.560
Any colleagues still around?

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.040
Get them to courier it to you.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.150
It's fine.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.730
I can handle it.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:42.390
You should go.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.520
I saw online

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.520
that massages can help.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:54.520
Do you want to try?

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.040
I can do it myself.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:20.490
The notes I saved say

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.110
to press the acupoint

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.150
on the back of your neck.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:25.870
You might not reach it well.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.080
I'll help.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:35.320
Come on.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.630
Lean back.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.430
Is this okay?

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.000
Yeah.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.720
Why did you save notes

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.390
on how to relieve headaches?

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.870
I get them sometimes.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:15.940
Is it always this bad

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.155
when you have a headache?

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.670
Not always.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:20.520
It just

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.960
happens sometimes.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:24.350
I've been working overtime

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.720
and ignored it.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.000
So it got worse.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.350
Can you stay here with me
a little longer?

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.520
Just until I fall asleep.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:03.350
Paopao,

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:04.810
go straight home

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.133
after you turn off the lights.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.760
Be careful.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.280
Mr. Shen,

00:29:09.533 --> 00:29:10.711
I'll leave her to you.

00:29:10.733 --> 00:29:11.444
Okay.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.110
Thanks for today.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.480
We were short-staffed.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.420
I owe you one.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.770
If you need anything,

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:24.670
let me know.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.250
Didn't you say

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.040
you'd deduct it from the 72 hours?

00:29:29.533 --> 00:29:31.050
Four hours and twenty-eight minutes.

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.000
I timed it.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.670
Let's not mix them up.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.390
Well, look at the time.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.960
Let's grab something to eat.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.180
I know

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.200
a great little place.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.080
Sure.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:49.670
But this doesn't count

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.110
towards the hours.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:53.760

to make you stay?

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:29.800
What are you cooking?

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:37.110
Fried egg with tomato.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.040
Very nice.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.000
Fried egg with tomato.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:42.730
I can do that.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:43.280
I'll cook.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.280
Are you okay?

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.520
Did I bump you?

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:11.040
No.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.630
Maybe I should cook.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.670
You got this.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.800
Do we have any other dishes?

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:38.290
Yes.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:39.530
Stir-fried shredded pork

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:40.511
and asparagus with pork.

00:33:40.533 --> 00:33:41.311
They're over there.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.560
Li Wu, you're amazing.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:52.870
This holiday is way too blessed.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:56.320
Nothing special.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.620
(Steps of fried egg with tomato)

00:34:15.133 --> 00:34:17.050
(If you want to practice
listening and speaking,)

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:18.888
(Translate)
(you can watch "The Big Bang Theory".)

00:34:18.933 --> 00:34:20.620
(They talk about
lots of science knowledge.)

00:34:20.622 --> 00:34:21.533
(It's good for learning.)

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.180
(Blunder: stumble around)

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:34.210
Li Wu,

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.560
can you get my hair-drying cap?

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.960
I forgot it.

00:34:37.555 --> 00:34:38.911
It should be on the balcony.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.360
Coming.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:52.860
The pink one.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:53.840
Found it?

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:56.710
Yeah.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.920
Found it.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.080
Thanks.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.520
Do you enjoy it?

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.440
What episode are you on?

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:29.880
You didn't know?

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.190
Let's watch together.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.000
Li Wu?

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:01.400
Hey.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.840
Why are you spacing out?

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:04.750
Well...

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:07.670
I... I'll go shower.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.977
I have to go back to school tomorrow.

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:25.920
Sleep early

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.000
after you shower.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.460
Do you really need to

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:23.670
go back that early?

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:29.050
Yeah.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:30.690
Ms. Xu wants me

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:31.750
to get back early

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.710
to handle the transfer paperwork.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.210
So you're really

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.490
not going home

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:42.400
on weekends for now?

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.980
They say

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.670
the Rocket Class moves really fast.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.000
I'm afraid I'll fall behind.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.880
True.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:02.980
Alright then.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.380
If you want to go home,

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.190
text me.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.110
I'll fetch you.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.310
Okay.

00:38:15.911 --> 00:38:18.150
Everyone in the Rocket Class
is very hardworking,

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.170
and the teachers

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:20.310
are the best.

00:38:21.177 --> 00:38:22.780
You were moved up to the Rocket Class

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.040
as a special exception,

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.230
so make sure you do your very best.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.440
I'll work hard.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.670
Let's go in.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:34.440
Class,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.000
hold on for a second.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.520
Let me introduce someone.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:42.560
This is Li Wu from Class Three.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.360
Starting today,

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:45.880
he'll be joining our class

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.790
and studying with us.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.840
You've probably heard

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.980
that his grades

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.422
have been improving very quickly.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.150
In the final exam last semester,

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:58.230
some of his subject scores

00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:59.650
were higher

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:01.040
than a few of ours.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.630
So don't slack off.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.230
Keep working hard.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.210
Let's give Li Wu a round of applause

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:10.560
and welcome him.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:15.710
Li Wu,

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.050
there's an empty seat
next to Tao Wanwen.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:19.360
You can sit there. Okay?

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.480
Okay.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:21.790
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:25.960
Class,

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:27.690
you're already

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:28.750
in the final stretch.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.880
You absolutely can't let up now.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:32.440
Work harder.

00:39:33.266 --> 00:39:34.688
Carry on with your study hall.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.360
I knew you'd come.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:44.080
Thanks.
