[Episode 23]

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.380
That should be enough.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.210
Hurry. Sit down.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.540
Oh, only an hour for lunch break.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.100
You asked me out to eat.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.290
It takes 20 minutes to travel.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.820
So…

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.770
We only have 40 minutes.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.850
So I ordered for you in advance.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.740
I got everything you wanted. Enough?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.930
Need to order more?

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.100
No.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.660
Let's start now!

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.570
Sure?

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.740
Enough for you?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.490
Sure.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.410
This is yours.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.410
Okay.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.340
One soup each.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.170
Why not have two?

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.060
No, I don't deserve it.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.820
You don't deserve it.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.410
Alright, here.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.940
Still need to stay in shape?

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.130
Of course.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.010
So particular.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.610
I have to teach my students.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.940
You have no idea how slim

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.010
the girls at our school are.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.100
You've seen them.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.500
Have I?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.940
No?

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.840
Yes.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.890
Tastes great.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.610
Here.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.780
I must speed up,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.570
or I'll be late.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.500
Take your time.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.500
I'm used to it.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.010
Take it slow with the food.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.220
Your stomach's on thin ice.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.540
Okay, Sir.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.220
It's so delicious.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.780
No rush.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.980
I can drive you over later.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.780
It'll take at most 20 minutes.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.500
I'll definitely make it in 15.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.820
You're faster than a DiDi driver?

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.290
Of course.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.820
Are you sure?

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.130
Let's go.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.450
Wait, I

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.450
bought you a coffee.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.850
You even thought of that.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.220
I worry you may embarrass your students

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.340
as you may be sleepy

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.220
in class like this.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.260
Your coffee.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.820
Thanks.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.780
I, um...

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.100
Shuhan, why haven't you answered me?

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.130
My stomach has been off recently.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.610
Are you sick?

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.690
I'm fine now. Everything is better.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.260
Look, I'm in good shape, right?

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.980
I just dressed up.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.290
I'll meet a friend for dinner.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.290
About to head out.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.610
By the way,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.380
how's everything going?

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.380
Going smoothly here.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.850
I think we'll start the project

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.410
in the East District in a few days.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.170
Once this is all over,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.060
let's travel and relax.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.820
Sounds good.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.020
Where do you want to go?

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.220
We can pack our bags and go.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.580
Anywhere will do.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.460
What's wrong?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.340
Why do you look so unhappy?

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.250
Are you mad at me?

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.020
No, of course not.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.020
How could I be unhappy?

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.980
Am I that kind of person?

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.460
Definitely not.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.540
You're my rock.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.140
Alright, I won't keep you.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.730
You've got so much going on tomorrow.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.250
I'm in a rush to head out.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.730
Bye. Love you.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.900
Based on the latest data feedback

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.140
from Sansan,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.900
only 3% of games in the market

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.930
are paid,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.050
while the vast majority are free.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.170
They make users watch ads constantly.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.580
Mom.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.170
Yuan.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.540
Shuhan's phone is turned off.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.780
Can you get in touch with her?

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.370
She's probably out with her boyfriend.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.020
Probably no signal.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.900
She'll call you back. Don't worry.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.660
Always wandering around all day,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.020
never letting us know in advance.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.250
Alright, I'll hang up.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.580
The phone you're calling is powered off.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.540
Go back and review it again.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.930
I need to take a call.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.810
Okay.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.610
Bye, Ms. Tan.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.930
Yuan.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.410
Siting.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:35.580
Is Shuhan with you?

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.580
No.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.540
What's wrong?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.250
Anything happened?

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.580
Probably nothing serious.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.250
Don't worry about it.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.460
If she contacts you,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.700
tell her to call me.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.250
No problem.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.050
Really, nothing's wrong?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.780
Let's find her first.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.250
You're her friend, right?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.220
Please settle her room fee shortly.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.140
She's three days overdue.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.660
If you don't pay,
we'll have to ask her to leave.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.340
Okay.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.020
Miss Wang.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.460
Miss Wang.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.250
Shuhan.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.340
It's me.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.540
Open the door.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.540
Shuhan.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.780
I'll pay the room fee later.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.490
Alright.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.660
A bit messy here.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.610
Wanna drink?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.980
How did you find me?

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.220
Your landlord contacted me.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.370
I forgot

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.730
you're my emergency contact.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.850
Thanks for making the trip.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:37.890
Why are you staying here?

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.770
I lost the apartment.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.130
I was short on money a while back,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.370
so I used

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.610
the apartment as collateral for a loan.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.980
Then I couldn't make the payments,

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.730
and they took the apartment.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.730
It got repossessed.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.300
You should've told me.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.300
How

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.530
was I supposed to tell you?

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.580
At the very least,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.610
you could've stayed at my place.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.530
You could've

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.580
stayed at home.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.060
How could I go back home?

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.060
How could I face them?

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.100
Our parents think I'm not capable.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.580
Previously, I even told them

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.580
I was working on a big project

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.370
that I was about to become successful,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.770
and I'd have lots of money.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.010
And in the end,

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.530
I lost the apartment you bought me.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.100
How can I go back?

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.300
Go to my place.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:06.900
Come on.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:08.780
Let's go.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.250
Just go back.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.580
Leave me alone.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.380
That's enough!

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:17.900
Look at yourself.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.300
What have you become?

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.420
So what?

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.300
The house is mortgaged,

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.020
and the car's gone.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:23.890
You can redeem them later.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:24.650
What's the big deal?

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.300
Where's

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.700
Wang Shuhan,
big shot of the East District?

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.740
Where is she?

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.460
Shuhan,

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.130
no matter what happens,

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.380
your family will always be there.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.610
I've rented a place for three months

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.940
and paid the fees.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:23.460
When it's up,

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.530
we can renew.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.770
Here are our three rules.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:27.820
First,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.660
your phone must be on 24/7

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.060
so I can reach you anytime.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.420
Second,

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.380
if you need money,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.940
please tell me right away.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.140
Third,

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.780
no more reckless investments.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:44.660
I have to go.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.660
Got work to do.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:46.980
If anything comes up,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.420
just let me know.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:09.780
Hello.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.300
Hello, do you have a reservation?

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:11.780
Yes.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.060
I found Shuhsn.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.180
If you're free these days,

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.490
could you spend some time with her?

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:21.660
Mr. Bai, right?

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:25.580
Okay.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.530
Ms. Tan, I'm off now.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.530
Bye, see you tomorrow.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.370
You have an hour to get dolled up.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.490
See you at our usual spot.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.850
A ton of coriander.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:54.890
Here,

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.940
your favorite special sauce.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:58.770
Thanks.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.300
Have a drink with me.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:04.850
Sure.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.100
Waitress!

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:07.370
Two beers, please.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.850
Okay.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.580
Thank you.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.610
You know, it's strange.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.130
Why does hotpot

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.300
only taste this amazing

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.370
when I'm eating it with you?

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.940
No one else gives me that feeling.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.940
Still remember this restaurant?

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.220
You brought me here
when we were students.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.580
Really?

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.130
Back then, while studying ballet,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.420
you also had to work outside.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.010
Your first job

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.820
was at a small convenience store

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.730
as a clerk.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.300
I remember it clearly,

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.850
your first month's salary

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.700
was 1,200 yuan.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.300
You said you would treat me to a meal

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.180
as soon as you got paid.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.180
Back then, we were right here.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.130
I dug in like there was no tomorrow

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.890
and ate over 200 yuan's worth,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.820
a fifth of your salary!

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.010
At that time, I thought

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.890
their hotpot was absolutely delicious.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:56.940
Your beers.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.250
Thanks.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.580
But later, when I was in Paris,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.340
I often craved hotpot,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.100
but it never tasted quite the same.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.730
Maybe without the right person.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.490
After so many years,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.060
a lot has changed.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.300
But thankfully,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.770
the taste of the hotpot here hasn't.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.770
When I eat hotpot with you,

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.300
my appetite's still the same.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.010
Eat up.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:43.730
Siting,

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.460
I watched your interview.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.490
You spoke really well.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.850
Stop putting me down.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:52.820
Really.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.490
Everything you've achieved

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.610
is well-deserved.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.820
I was really nervous back then.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.490
You know what?

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.300
I was thinking

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.300
if only you were there.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.060
You're so good with words.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:08.490
So I thought,

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.980
if I ever get interviewed again,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.890
I'll bring you along,

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.130
no awkwardness for sure.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.250
How are things with Feng Rui?

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:21.180
Pretty good.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.300
Eat.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.730
His mom didn't say anything else?

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.250
Do you think it's possible?

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.530
She used Le's phone

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:35.730
to ask me to meet.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.530
She probably feels like

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.890
she can't hold onto Feng Rui,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.490
so onto Le with all her might.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.730
I bet she's been talking trash
about me behind my back.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.300
I mean, Le's been acting different

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.700
toward me lately.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.460
Feng Rui loves you so much.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.300
No matter what happens,

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.780
he'll always be by your side.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.130
And I believe

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.130
it won't be long

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.980
before Le comes back to you too.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.290
It's been 12 years.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:10.660
Back when I was at my lowest,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.250
I never imagined things

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.420
could turn out like this.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.330
Feng Rui was gone,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.140
my dad had disappeared,

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.090
and I lost the baby.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.380
I felt like my world had collapsed.

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.140
But now, looking back,

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.330
it's all in the past.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.460
So no one goes

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.050
through life without setbacks.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.380
The key is to make peace with yourself.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.700
The shadow ahead means

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.570
the sun is shining behind us,

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:40.810
right?

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.380
But now,

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.770
I have nothing.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.090
Really?

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.140
You have me,

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.730
Yuan,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.620
and Zu.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.530
Zu.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.660
Here, drink up.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.860
Eat.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.010
Eat this.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:25.980
Bao.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.260
Bao.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.300
Look into this person and this account.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.300
Bro,

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.020
we're working overtime here.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.580
What's this about?

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.100
Drop everything else.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.100
We need to find out.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.060
Start with this one.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.700
[Skyline Magnificence]

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.220
Cheer up.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:05.940
Try to track it.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:16.660
Come on, run.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.660
Get ready.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.300
Go!

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:39.820
Feng Lexuan,

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.500
see how fast I was going just now?

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:43.860
What's wrong?

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.180
Nothing.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.300
Where were you the other day?

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.340
Why were you absent from class?

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.060
What's wrong with you?

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.980
You've been so down lately.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.660
Still thinking about Ms. Wen?

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:01.860
Feng Le Xuan,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.940
what's bothering you?

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.220
Say it,

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.020
and you'll feel better.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:10.860
If

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.180
you thought someone was dead,

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.780
but she's actually alive.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:16.700
What would you do?

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.420
My grandma loved me so much

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.620
when I was a baby,

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:23.980
but

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.540
she passed away when I was seven.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.300
If

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.780
someone tells me she is alive,

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.540
I'll

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.260
be really happy.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.900
My mom is alive.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.900
Your mom is alive?

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.220
Your birth mother?

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:42.780
The one who gave birth to you?

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.580
You should be happy.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.300
Exactly, Feng Le Xuan!

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.500
Ever since you were little,

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.420
all you wanted was a mom.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.020
And now, your real mom is alive.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:54.820
That's amazing.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.420
What does your mom do?

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.620
Why did she tell you

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.460
she had passed away back then?

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.140
She abandoned me for her dance career.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.180
So I don't know how to face her

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.780
or whether I should forgive her.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.300
What brings you here?

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.300
Haven't eaten, right?

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.140
Ms. Ming made

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.820
braised beef

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.340
with tomatoes,

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.300
your favorite dish.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.660
The midterms were last week.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.060
I got a total score of 270.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.260
My highest was Chinese with 92,

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.860
and my lowest was Math with 88.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.580

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.460

Don't worry.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.780
I'll be there sooner or later.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.820

No.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.740
I'm a bit worried.

Don't worry,

he is very decisive.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:51.420
It's okay.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.340
I forgot to tell you.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.700
He knows you're his mother.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:04.660
What?

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.900
That day, he suddenly asked me.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:10.900
He asked,

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.700
"My mom is Ms. Tan, right?"

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.260
What did you say?

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.780
I said, "Yes."

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.540
Then he seriously asked me

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.340
a few more questions.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:25.900
What did he ask you?

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.580
He asked,

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.620
"Does she

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.780
love you?"

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.500
I said, "She does."

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:35.860
Then he said,

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.780
"As much as I love you?"

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.580
I told him, "Yes."

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:45.780
I think

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:49.220
he's starting to slowly accept you.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:50.940
That's a good thing.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.140
I've thought countless times

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.580
about how to explain to him

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.180
why I left back then,

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.460
and why I've come back now

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.660
to find him.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:08.780
I've even thought about

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.860
the expression I should have

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.580
when saying goodbye if he rejects me.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.340
All I want

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.620
is to be a good mother in his eyes.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.100
But I didn't expect him

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.020
to be so perceptive.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.060
So,

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:34.660
thank you.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.420
Why?

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.060
For raising him so well.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.180
It makes me feel less guilty.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:50.700
From now on,

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.420
we'll raise him together.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.500
You'll do a better job than I did.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.340
So,

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:04.860

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.060

to officially meet?

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:11.540
Good idea.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.300
The ceremony matters.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.660
Where should we meet?

a meal together?

In this case,

I'll prepare something proper.
