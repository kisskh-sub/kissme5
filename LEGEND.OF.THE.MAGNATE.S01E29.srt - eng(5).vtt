00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.510
Everyone in the army is watching eagerly,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.000
hoping to get paid soon

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.450
so they can go home,

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.760
buy houses and land, and find wives.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.090
Their eyes are red with anticipation.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.010
If you keep them here

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.270
to run those salt fields,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.270
how are we supposed to disband them?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.080
What kind of idea is that?

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.910
Stand down.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.720
After more than 10 years of war,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.080
[Righteous and Diligent]

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.300
the army is poor,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.930
and the common people... are even poorer.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.670
I know

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.080
you all

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.700
don't want to mistreat

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.670
your soldiers who fought so hard.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.800
You want to pay them as soon as possible

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.000
so they can return home
to their sons and grandchildren.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.000
That's why

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.540
I've invited young master Li Qin

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.020
and Mr. Gu here—

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.600
these young business elites—

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.160
to give us some advice.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.340
Only when Nanjing prospers

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.730
and the people have money in their pockets

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:21.790
[Righteous and Diligent]

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.630
can we collect taxes.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.490
That's the right approach.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.160
How could we take money from the people?

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:30.960
Besides,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.100
Li Wantang, known as Li Million
from the capital,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.010
is a good friend of mine.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.000
He sent his son here to do business,

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.730
buying salt fields.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.560
That's a blessing
for the Liangjiang region.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.960
From now on, none of you shall

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.120
speak like this again

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.750
and make things difficult for him.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.870
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.000
Your Excellency is wise.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.120
Your Excellency.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.530
Please sit down.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:16.780
Come on.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.780
Have a seat.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:20.670
Sit.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.170
They say you're a remarkable figure.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.730
What insights can you offer me?

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.330
I've heard bits and pieces

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.480
about Your Excellency's difficulties.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.940
I wonder
what Your Excellency intends to do.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.330
Tell me first,

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.210
what are your thoughts

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.540
on doing business?

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.270
I see business as...

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.240
the Great Way.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.700
You're wrong, mister.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.840
Scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants—

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.630
merchants stand at the bottom.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.600
Confucius said,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
"The small man comprehends profit,

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.670
while the superior man
comprehends righteousness."

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.850
Your Excellency is wrong.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.040
What did you just say?

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.730
I said, Your Excellency is wrong.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.000
Business

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.100
is nothing more than buying and selling.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.060
Back then, Confucius and Mencius

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.600
traveled tirelessly throughout the world,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.800
and what was that for?

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.270
Of course, it was

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.350
to save all people under heaven

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.870
and establish moral authority.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.670
Then how did they save the people

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.080
and establish this moral authority?

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.550
It was nothing more than persuading rulers
of various states

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.610
and peddling their political ideas.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.240
Your Excellency yourself
used the word "peddling."

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.970
Wasn't that already business?

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.140
That's sophistry.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.770
Without trade,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.150
goods couldn't circulate
throughout the world,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.810
and people would still be born

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.600
and die in the same place,
living in caves.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.550
Isn't business

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.510
the Great Way?

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.960
Strong ships and powerful cannons,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.270
the gains and losses of states,

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.840
and the rise and fall of nations—

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.900
all depend on this.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.510
So how can you say business

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.510
isn't important?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.330
If you put it that way,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.120
I suppose...

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.870
you have a point.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.250
In that case,

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.720
businessmen

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.080
are just like scholars,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.870
both seekers of the Way.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.390
There's no real difference.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:29.650
For scholars,

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.200
seeking office is the lesser path,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.600
while saving the world is
the greater path.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.960
For merchants,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.440
pursuing wealth is the lesser path,

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.790
while enriching the world is
the greater path.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.320
This student, though lacking in talent,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.030
has a heart

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.070
that yearns to follow the greater path.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.820
Anyone can speak grand words.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.730
I've heard plenty of them.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.840
Tell me your true intentions first.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.510
When I first entered the business world,

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.440
I thought everything in this world

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.320
was merely a tool for profit.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.550
I believed that keeping one's word,

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.840
following through on promises,

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.000
and ensuring both parties benefit

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.200
was the greater path.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.780
But merely "both parties"

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.200
is too narrow.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.280
It's like two armies at war—

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.000
those who care only about
winning a city or a fortress

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.240
aren't true generals.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.040
Just as when I was a tea merchant—

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.150
only after seeing the tea trade
across the province

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.790
and even the entire nation

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.360
did I know

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.270
how I should pursue this path myself.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.330
Only then could I see the big picture.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.320
But now...

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.320
now my thoughts

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.770
have changed somewhat.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.760
I wonder,

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.270
why limit oneself to one profession

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.100
or focus on just one business?

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.040
Since arriving in Nanjing,

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.480
I've witnessed devastation everywhere

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.000
and people struggling to survive.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.870
And I think

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.850
this is a good business opportunity.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.790
If possible,

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.630
I would like to assist Your Excellency

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.830
in managing Jiangnan

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.110
and planning for the nation.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.720
Audacious young man,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.780
you truly are an audacious young man.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.560
Even I wouldn't dare

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.930
speak so boldly about managing Jiangnan.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.840
However, such ambition

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.170
is indeed commendable.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.770
Don't just be someone

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.430
who talks.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.240
I must see actual results.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.680
If you want results,

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.440
Your Excellency will need to
follow my instructions.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.770
Follow your instructions?

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.870
Young man,

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.520
that's quite a bold request.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.720
I came to Jiangnan

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.610
not for wealth or position.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.200
Your Excellency has brought

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.130
my entire family here as hostages.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.570
I only ask

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.260
that they return home safely.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:02.670
You really

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.960
don't want money or position?

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.530
What use are position and wealth anyway?

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.480
I only fear that one day,

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.550
your forces will fall into chaos again,

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.960
the people of Jiangnan
will suffer terribly,

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.320
and my hometown will be destroyed
once more—

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.360
then there will truly be no hope left.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.290
Neither the country nor the people

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.850
can bear such devastation.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.600
In times of chaos,

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:24.850
what use

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.090
are position

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.630
or wealth?

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:29.960
Very well.

truly manage Jiangnan

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.920

catch a glimpse of her.

She was the top courtesan here
10 years ago.

Her coffin is still at a temple.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.720
The daughter has no money for the burial.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.280

be boundless.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.720
It actually is.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.590
Confucius, in his lifetime,

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.920
praised very few people.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.880
Among them was the Prime Minister of Qi,

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.740
Guan Zhong, also known as Guanzi.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.590
Stop showing off.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.610
Just tell me.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.680
Back then, Qi was remote
and sparsely populated,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.680
so Guan Zhong established
a women's quarter.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.680
That women's quarter

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.270
was just like what we have now
at the Qinhuai River.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.030
And the result?

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.160
Within three years,

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.480
the capital, Linzi, became prosperous,

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.410
with crowds of people everywhere.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.720
I know Your Excellency is
a master of Neo-Confucianism.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720
You uphold the principle,
"Preserve heavenly principles

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.680
and suppress human desires."

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.000
But in matters under heaven,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.680
if you go against human desires,

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.310
you can't accomplish anything.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.390
The Qinhuai River has always been

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.440
a place where scholars
and refined gentlemen linger.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.110
So I'd like to ask Your Excellency

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.110
to allocate

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.750
100,000 taels from the treasury.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:02.400
First,

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.810
to dredge the Qinhuai River.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.960
Second, to provide interest-free loans

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.030
to those brothels

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.860
so the girls there

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.110
can buy more hairpins and jewelry,

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:12.920
fabrics,

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.860
fine food, and tea snacks.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.270
Then we need to spread

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:17.370
this news quickly.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.550
Once word spreads
among merchants and travelers,

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:20.880
they'll come in droves.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.310
With more people coming,

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.310
more business being done,

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:24.570
and more circulation,

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.950
won't the tax revenue increase as well?

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.440
By then, Your Excellency,

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.070
you won't have to worry about
collecting money.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.440
What nonsense is that?

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.290
Using government funds

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.030
to lend to those houses of pleasure?

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.320
If those censors find out about this

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.270
and submit memorials against me,

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:42.530
what will become of me?

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:44.480
Those memorials would merely

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.850
accuse you of indulging in wine and women.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.690
Isn't that preferable to
having chaos everywhere?

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.880
That's one way to look at it.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.350
But all the officials

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.270
are watching.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.580
How can I,
a respected master of Neo-Confucianism,

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:02.990
act out of line like this?

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.750
Tell me clearly

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.450
what you're really planning.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.830
We haven't earned a single coin,

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.270
and now you want 100,000 taels?

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:10.880
No way.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.790
Gaozi once said,

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.960
"Food and sex are human nature."

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.290
All people in the world

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.000
care about nothing
but food and sexual desires.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:19.870
I believe

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.440
that once we revive the pleasure quarters
along the Qinhuai River,

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.440
within a year,

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.160
the vitality of Nanjing

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.600
will gradually recover.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.090
Ridiculous.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.640
Restoring vitality through those women?

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.500
What else then?

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:34.410
Renovating the examination hall

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.200
and printing a few Confucian classics?

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.730
Will that revive anything?

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:39.600
Your Excellency,

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.070
we agreed from the beginning

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.730
to manage Jiangnan together.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.450
If so, we must adopt

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.880
a business perspective.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:47.030
Business is

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.240
nothing more than
the outflow and inflow of money.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.980
If you truly agree to this,

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.190
you'll demonstrate to the whole world

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.200
your determination

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.270
to restore normal life here.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:58.880
First, revitalize the market

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.400
and fill everyone's stomachs.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.510
The investment is small,

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.970
but the returns are great.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.010
One hundred thousand taels
will be effective

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.920
and will also make a statement.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.110
Your Excellency,

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.909
don't you think it's a good deal?

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:11.710
Really?

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.400
Speaking of which,

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.790
when I visited

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.320
some brothels
with Your Excellency yesterday,

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.260
it truly opened my eyes.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.550
Can Your Excellency teach this student

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.280
some of those terms and jargon?

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:24.550
Enough, enough.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:26.469
Let's not discuss this topic anymore.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.260
Fine, I'll approve this money.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.480
Your Excellency has
the heart of a Bodhisattva.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.400
Since that's the case,

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.530
I'd like to ask Your Excellency
to allocate another sum.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.560
Isn't that enough already?

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.510
People will say

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:38.920
I came to Nanjing as an official

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.280
only to spend all the money

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.710
on businesses along the Qinhuai River—

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.550
wouldn't that be utterly humiliating?

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:44.710
Not at all, not at all.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.230
The second allotment of funds
I'm requesting

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.230
is for two things.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:47.800
First,

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.320
to gather the finest woodblock carvers
from across the country,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.630
rebuild the academy here,

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.110
and carve the "Complete Library
of the Four Treasuries."

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:53.570
Second,

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.670
to resume
the imperial examinations this year

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.030
and renovate the examination halls.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.510
It's the way of civil
and martial governance—

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.840
alternating
between tension and relaxation.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.110
How much money would that require?

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.240
Also 100,000 taels.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.880
It's like cutting a big watermelon
in half.

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.550
Half for you.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.320
Half for you.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.710
And nothing left for me.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.560
Then I'll just spread my wings.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.960
Fly away to buy another one.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.070
Mr. Liao, Mr. Chang,

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:27.200
practicing kung fu?

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.640
Let's go inside
to practice internal energy.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:31.870
I...

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:36.320
Miss Liao.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.360
What, am I a ghost?

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.820
All of you are running away
at the sight of me.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:53.280
Tell me,

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:54.710
what on earth is going on?

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:55.550
Why does everyone who sees me

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:56.810
have that expression?

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.280
Where do you think you're going?

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.070
Tell me quickly.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:01.400
What exactly happened?

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.360
-Mr. Gu is back!
-Mr. Gu is back!

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.360
-Mr. Gu!
-Mr. Gu!

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.360
-Good fortune and peace to you, Mr. Gu!
-Good fortune and peace to you, Mr. Gu!

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.550
-Wait, why are you...
-Mr. Gu.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:19.070
It's me.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.320
I'm from Henian House.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.230
I'm from Taoye House!

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.960
We're from Shuiming House!

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.420
We're from Hongxue House!

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.030
Alright.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:25.440
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.070
I know you.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:26.910
I know you all.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:27.880
Why have you all gathered here

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.510
to see me?

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:30.680
No need to massage, no need.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.220
What's this all about?

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.200
My good sir,

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.550
why are you being

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.880
so distant with us all of a sudden?

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.840
-That's right!
-Exactly!

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.510
The other day, you came to drink with us,

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.360
enjoying yourself

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.510
and telling all sorts of jokes—

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.670
why are you acting so formal
all of a sudden?

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.000
-Yes.
-Indeed!

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.630
Don't talk nonsense!

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:43.070
When did I

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:43.960
tell so many jokes?

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.840
Get to the point.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.480
Mr. Gu,

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.670
we've come this time

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:47.630
for just one thing.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:48.550
Along the Qinhuai River,

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.970
hundreds of sisters

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:51.110
sent us here as representatives

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:52.650
to kowtow to you properly.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.360
If it weren't for you and His Excellency

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.760
looking after our business

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.440
and writing an elegiac couplet
for the Grande Dame,

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.620
we would've all

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.470
starved to death long ago.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.670
-That's right.
-Exactly.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.230
-Indeed.
-Yes.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.400
The Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.760
has even allocated silver for us

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.960
to repair our houses.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.130
Tomorrow,

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.680
they'll start dredging the Qinhuai River!

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:11.920
Wouldn't you say

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.550
this is like being blessed
by a living Bodhisattva?

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.360
-Yes.
-Indeed!

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.390
-A pleasure Bodhisattva!
-Yes.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.670
-Our great benefactor!
-Indeed.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.570
When I go back,

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.630
I'll set up a longevity tablet for you

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.190
and place it alongside the tablet

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.720
of our good sir, Guan Zhong.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:26.760
Come on, come on!

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.300
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:29.800
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.510
Please get up, get up!

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:31.310
Please get up!

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:32.920
Just call him Guan Zhong.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.000
Don't say "my good sir."

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Address him properly.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.320
And there's no such thing
as a pleasure Bodhisattva,

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.320
only living ones.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:39.960
Alright, you're absolutely right.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.510
We've

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.500
kowtowed

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:43.030
and will leave after saying
what we came to say.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.550
We know

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.630
you're newly married.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.440
Our presence here

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.500
must be inconvenient for you, right?

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:51.360
And we know you're an honest
and upright official.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.070
Therefore,

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:53.830
we've prepared some rouge

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.800
for your wife

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.780
and your mother,

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.110
along with face powder

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.300
and some fabric.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.770
Please don't refuse.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.930
If you refuse,

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.530
you're looking down on us.

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:05.230
-Yes, exactly.
-Yes.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.710
Don't be nervous.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.980
All 160 brothels

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.740
along the Qinhuai River—

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.070
the girls have all agreed

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:16.470
to keep the back doors of the houses open
for you day and night!

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.770
Even if you don't bring a single coin,

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.190
we'll take care of you
for the rest of your days!

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:25.120
-For the rest of your days!
-For the rest of your days!

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.430
Alright, alright.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:27.710
Thank you, thank you all.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.710
Please go back now.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:29.790
Look, everyone,

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.630
Mr. Gu hasn't been drinking,

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:32.800
so he's being shy!

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.710
-Indeed!
-Yes!

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.110
It's perfectly normal
for a real man to enjoy

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:38.440
the company of courtesans!

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.900
-That's right!
-Exactly!

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.190
-Do come often!
-Please come often!

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.550
Remember to visit our Henian House.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.280
Come to our Taoye House!

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:14.230
Yu'er.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.690
Doing embroidery?

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.440
How did you,

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.730
a woman who wields weapons,

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:24.460
suddenly start embroidering?

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.110
There's food saved for you in the kitchen.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:28.240
I've already eaten.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.470
I've made tea for you too.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.100
You're so thoughtful.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.370
What's this?

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.130
A list of gifts sent to you.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.800
Didn't I tell you?

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.110
We can't accept gifts

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:47.840
from anyone.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.080
Why don't you listen?

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.000
Mother wants you to read the gift list.

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:00.590
[Gift List]

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.670
Ten boxes of

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.510
agarwood bracelets, carved with

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.280
hollowed-out swastika patterns.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.820
Six gold-inlaid jade
peach-shaped hairpins.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:11.400
A pair of

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.480
rose-tourmaline twist-pattern bracelets.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.810
One long gold-inlaid white jade hairpin.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.040
A pair of gold-inlaid

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.360
spring water green jade
peach-shaped rings.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.630
One hundred...

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.730
Virility Pills.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:25.960
These were sent by people
from the brothels, right?

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:26.800
What kind of gift is this?

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.200
Do I look like someone
who needs such pills?

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.130
Finish reading the list first.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.460
Sixty pieces of

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:47.630
erotic paintings, large and small.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.930
A complete set of
The Sexual Arts of the Bedchamber.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.730
There's no way to explain this now.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.400
Yu'er.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.960
Um, Yu'er.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:03.800
Yu'er!

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.840
Stop embroidering.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.670
Talk to me,

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.510
okay?

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.480
If you're really going to

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.510
deal with those officials every day

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.070
while I only know how to handle weapons,

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:18.590
ride horses, and shoot arrows,

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.250
wouldn't that embarrass you?

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:21.850
You should hire a tutor

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.620
to teach me reading, writing,

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.300
embroidery, and cooking,

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.170
so I won't end up
being sent back to Shanxi by you.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:30.960
Who told you these things?

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.670
Aren't they clearly trying to
drive us apart?

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:33.510
Who said it? I'll go find them!

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:34.960
Why are you being so fierce?

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.770
I said it.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.680
What's wrong?

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.960
Just keep practicing with these things.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.090
When you're with me,

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.510
you don't need to
put yourself through all this.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.320
If you really want to
learn to read and write,

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.180
I'll teach you.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.030
There's no one under heaven

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.360
who could teach you better than I can,

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:09.800
right?

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.760
I knew it.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.190
The moment I walked in,
everyone who saw me

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.920
acted like they'd seen a ghost.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:29.090
And you were smiling at me.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:29.760
Take it.

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.600
I know you're angry inside.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.480
Just let it out.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:36.280
When you feel better, I feel better too.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.410
As husband and wife,

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.610
we don't hold things in like others do.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.490
Everyone's been saying lately

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.360
that you've been visiting brothels
along the Qinhuai River every day,

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.690
and I didn't believe it.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.090
Of course you shouldn't believe them.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:54.090
Did you go then?

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.150
I went for one day.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:58.840
If I told you

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.000
that I went there on official duty,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.200
would you believe me?

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.280
Would you really believe that yourself?
