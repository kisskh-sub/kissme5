00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:41.190
(Adapted from the Jinjiang Novel
"Sniper Butterfly" by author Qibaosu)

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.180
=Episode 11=

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.490
Look.

00:01:47.488 --> 00:01:49.600
This is the cross-section
of his chest X-ray.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.620
Normally,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.330
the foramen ovale here is closed.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.044
But his foramen ovale is not closed.

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.066
So we can preliminarily determine

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.690
that this is the cause of your migraine.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.620
Is it serious?

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.180
Actually, a quarter of adults

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.260
have this issue.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.177
But people with
an open foramen ovale

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.466
have a 2.5 times higher risk of onset
than normal people.

00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:14.980
It's just that some people

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.511
never have symptoms congenitally.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.940
If it occurs,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.410
it may be because

00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:21.977
they have previously experienced

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.400
some external stimulus.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.780
When was your first attack?

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.850
Had you experienced any

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.450
stimulus or trauma before?

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.890
Previous doctors also said this.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.380
They just told me to rest more

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.888
and it would get better.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.850
So, besides resting,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.340
there's no other way?

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.940
Theoretically, surgery is an option.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.044
But usually, it's not necessary.
So we don't choose it.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.690
We still focus on medication

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.288
and gradual treatment.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.290
But during treatment,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.100
the most important thing is to adjust

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.290
your lifestyle habits.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.555
For example, what we often hear is,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.933
early to bed, early to rise,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.660
get enough sleep,

00:03:07.088 --> 00:03:08.577
and avoid staying up late.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.060
Keep your emotions stable
when facing things.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.820
That's it.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.660
Your sister

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.800
is really nice to you.

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:25.244
You don't need to remember it.

00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:26.660
I'll organize the precautions

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.866
and send them to you later.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.100
Thanks.

00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:50.333
Go get your medicine.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.010
Thanks.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.980
That's it for today.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.690
Thanks.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.260
Wait.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.130
On Saturday,

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.777
there's an event at the archery club.

00:04:00.822 --> 00:04:01.511
Don't forget.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.940
I won't.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.980
I'll bring my new bow.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.220
You can check it for me.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.100
Gladly.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.060
Archery, huh?

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.820
I'm interested too.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.340
Then...

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.700
Dr. Lu probably won't mind

00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:18.711
if I go with you guys.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.580
I won't mind.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.490
Of course not.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.250
It's a group activity anyway.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.600
More people make it fun.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.250
Then, bye.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.020
See you

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.810
on Saturday.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.050
See you Saturday.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.100
Drink less.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.580
What are you looking for?

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.066
I'm looking for a pharmacy

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.320
to buy you a pill organizer.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.290
This...

00:04:56.622 --> 00:04:57.555
isn't necessary.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.730
Just a few medicines.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.844
I remember them clearly.

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:02.700
I'm afraid you might forget
when you're busy.

00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:03.700
Having a pill organizer

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.580
is very convenient.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.020
By the way, when did you start

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.050
liking archery?

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.540
I...

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.410
I...

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.490
Actually, I've always

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.490
been quite interested.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.100
It's just

00:05:24.377 --> 00:05:26.200
that I never had a chance to learn.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.370
I...

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.490
Will it affect you guys?

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.170
No.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.044
There's a pharmacy over there.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.100
After buying it, just take a taxi.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.466
I'm going to be late for work.

00:05:59.844 --> 00:06:00.850
Raise it a bit on the left.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.400
Is that okay?

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.930
Done.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:17.660
Thanks, Sister.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.780
Bye.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:57.140
(Bei'ao Motors)

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.220
This time,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.370
our biggest feature

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.100
is that we added

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.170
a beautiful woman element.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.140
It can showcase

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.610
the visual highlights of the product,

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.980
and through the story,

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.780
it can also show
Bei'ao Motors' advantages.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.340
So this time,

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.460
that's all of our content.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.540
This concept doesn't work.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.044
Think of something else.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.930
Why?

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.810
Beauty, technology, and adventure.

00:07:18.222 --> 00:07:19.622
These are all a man's favorites.

00:07:19.622 --> 00:07:20.600
What's wrong with that?

00:07:20.622 --> 00:07:21.810
Do you think a conventional

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.930
and traditional idea

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.580
can help us stand out

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.410
in the pitch?

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.050
The current creative director
of Yiwen Creative Dream

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.100
seems to be Wu Fu, right?

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:33.933
He's really impressive.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:35.780
A while ago,

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.100
he wrote, filmed, and edited

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.200
a sign language ad himself,

00:07:38.244 --> 00:07:39.466
and won a One Show award.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.850
I'm really impressed.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.610
It's too late today.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.111
Let's call it a day.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.850
Everyone, keep thinking.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.050
Open new ideas.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.290
See if there are

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:51.250
other angles.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.244

Sister, you're back.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.060
You've improved so fast.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.980
Over thirty ranks.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.300
You're amazing.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.460
Too bad,

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.770
I didn't make the top thirty.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.100
Don't improve so fast.

00:09:26.177 --> 00:09:27.777
I don't even know how to praise you.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.490
Have you eaten?

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:33.650
Yes.

Yes.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.066
You've been working late recently.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.130
Yeah.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:09.940
There's a new project.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.888
The schedule is really tight.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.060
But we haven't had
a satisfactory idea yet.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.060
By the way, you're a man too.

00:10:22.244 --> 00:10:24.066
Why don't you give me some inspiration?

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.730
If you were choosing
an off-road vehicle,

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.220
what would you care about most?

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.888
I haven't thought about it.

Forget it.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.890
I'll think on my own.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.177
I'll take the mango.

You should have played it
from the note "F" to the note "G".

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.130
Was it too far

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:41.650

You're welcome. I'm happy too.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.060
Sorry.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.370
I just had a work call.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.577
Thanks for staying with her.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:55.220
Understood.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.250
Can you send me a copy

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.355

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.490
Sure.

looking so happy

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.820
was just too beautiful,
so I took a video of it.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.130
Then I'll add you on WeChat, okay?

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:07.370
Okay. Thanks.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:09.580
Got it.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.010
Great, sent.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:14.770
Alright.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:15.850

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:16.370

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.700
Bye.

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:20.577
You're all sweaty from playing.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:26.730
Li Wu.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.650
Sister, where did you just go?

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.022
I went to play the piano.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.940
How was it? Fun?

00:16:32.466 --> 00:16:34.222
I just finished the last science talk

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.610
about AI applications.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.820
It's really extensive.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.750
It can be used
for environmental protection,

00:16:38.755 --> 00:16:40.488
data collection
and environmental analysis.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.850
And if used properly,
it can also protect

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.044
the planet's water resources,

00:16:44.133 --> 00:16:46.177
animal populations,
and our living environment.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.340
I never knew before

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.250
what AI was.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:49.220
But I think

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.130
it could really change

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.220
how humans live.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.220
So high tech isn't the focus.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.100
It's the lifestyle changes

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.370
brought by technology.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.860
I just thought of the idea
of the G-series concept.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:10.700
Good morning.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:11.980
Morning.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.090
Morning, Jin.

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:14.155
- Morning, Jin.
- Morning.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.111
How's it going?

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:21.490
After the weekend,

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.220
does anyone have new ideas?

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.490
Okay, I'll start.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.660
This time I want to be bolder.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.010
Not just a pure commercial
product display.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.420
I want to make it a microfilm.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.180
A story-driven ad.

00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:43.733
Jin, the portrayal of the mountain woman

00:17:43.755 --> 00:17:44.810
that you mentioned just now

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.050
fits me perfectly.

00:17:46.622 --> 00:17:48.570
If, like you, the kids
would probably run away.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.490
Jin, am I not cute?

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:51.700
Cute.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.380
Jin.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.460
Something's off with Bei'ao Motors.

00:17:58.111 --> 00:17:58.777
What's wrong?

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.220
They suddenly told me
that I don't need to go

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.240
for today's in-stock pitch.

00:18:02.244 --> 00:18:03.644
Let me do it online via video.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.866
Their purchasing attitude
is very perfunctory.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.377
The questions asked are off the mark.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.190
Feels like just going
through the procedures.

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:10.940
Seems like they don't want us to get in.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.660
I'll contact Mr. Chen.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.200
If you have any contacts there,

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:18.000
check as well.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.570
Okay.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.380
I'll go to Bei'ao Motors.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:31.900
Mr. Chen.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.460
About AusStar's in-stock issue,

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.490
do you have any news?

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.419
Not being in the database will affect

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.620
our G-series creative pitch.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.420
Could you help us

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:38.980
ask again?

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.250
Jin.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.770
Did you meet Mr. Chen?

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.460
No.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:57.810
Jin.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.380
I just found out

00:18:59.444 --> 00:19:00.977
this time for the G-series project,

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.010
Mr. Chen seems to have

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.488
a pre-selected partner company.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:04.700
Which one?

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.022
Yiwen Creative Dream.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.866
I heard their Director Wu

00:19:08.866 --> 00:19:10.090
already went to Bei'ao Motors

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.466
for two internal meetings.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.490
The employees all saw it.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.660
Mr. Chen and those guys

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.570
get along very well.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.900
So I guess

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.380
the pitch is just a formality.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.660
Mr. Chen doesn't want

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.879
too many companies competing.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.380
So, he used the in-stock qualification

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.290
to block us.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.250
Is there a way to bypass Mr. Chen

00:19:28.288 --> 00:19:29.733
and get the in-stock qualification?

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.533
Yes.

00:19:31.511 --> 00:19:32.533
But it's not easy.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.090
Speak.

00:19:34.844 --> 00:19:36.220
For their external communications,

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.730
the overall head is Shen Jun.

00:19:37.822 --> 00:19:39.600
Apparently, she
has special approval rights

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.600
at the director level.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:41.660
If she agrees,

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.380
it can be done.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.490
Can anyone contact her?

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.050
Let me see her info first.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:52.090
This is her.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.380
(Shen Jun's profile)

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.088
The scene of you all

00:20:01.088 --> 00:20:02.810
looking so happy was just too beautiful.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.770
So I took a video of it.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.133
Then I'll add you on WeChat, okay?

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.570
It's her.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.550
(During break, anyone wants coffee?)

00:20:21.555 --> 00:20:23.220
(Qie Tea House)

00:20:36.688 --> 00:20:38.090
Hello, I'd like a fresh milk tea.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.660
Hello, Ms. Shen.

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:44.660
It's you.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.250
What a coincidence.

00:20:47.177 --> 00:20:48.660
This time, it's not a coincidence.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.570
I came specifically to see you.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.140
First, allow me to introduce myself.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.010
I'm the creative director of AusStar,

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:55.700
Cen Jin.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.660
We're currently bidding

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.220
for the G-series marketing project

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.800
of Bei'ao Motors' new car.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.380
Please enjoy.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.250
Thank you.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.050
Actually, coming to see me like this

00:21:15.466 --> 00:21:17.290
is considered going over
the chain of command.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:18.940
So I was wondering,

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.770
are you very confident

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:21.730
in your creativity?

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.460
AusStar wants to become

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.220
Bei'ao Motors'

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.330
long-term partner.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.660
For this G-series

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.730
new car launch,

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.688
our team has also come up
with a very interesting

00:21:30.711 --> 00:21:31.980
and creative proposal.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.010
As the leader,

00:21:34.311 --> 00:21:35.460
of course, I must go all out.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.980
Actually, I've heard

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.140
of your name

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.330
in previous Bei'ao Motors projects.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.220
Just never had the chance

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.700
to connect it with you personally.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.010
But honestly speaking,

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.860
I know nothing

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.530
about AusStar.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.730
I understand your concern.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:55.250
After all, we are

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.140
a relatively new face

00:21:57.177 --> 00:21:58.570
among Bei'ao Motors' partners.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:21:59.940
But I believe

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:00.860
our creative proposal

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:02.330
will refresh your perspective.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.660
And, honestly,

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.380
I also really need this opportunity.

00:22:16.844 --> 00:22:17.777
Here's what we'll do.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.311
Regarding the in-stock issue,

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.220
I can help you.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.730
But in-stock is in-stock,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.860
pitching is pitching.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.660
This new car promotion

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.140
is also Bei'ao Motors'

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.622
most important project this year.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.660
So what we want

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:34.980
is the best creativity.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.330
Of course.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.822
As long as we get the entry ticket,

00:22:37.844 --> 00:22:39.660
we will compete on merit.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:40.490
Good.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.660
For the creative pitch,

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.066
I'll be there the whole time.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.290
Looking forward

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.460
to you and your team

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.000
giving your best performance.

00:22:47.844 --> 00:22:48.700
Thanks, Ms. Shen.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:49.688
See you then.

00:23:05.444 --> 00:23:06.822
(I'll work overtime these two days.)

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.222
(Can't come back this weekend.)

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:14.460
(Okay.)

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:16.800
(You've worked hard, Sister.)

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:28.660
Jin.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:29.940
You okay?

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:30.700
Stayed up again?

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.090
It's fine.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.620
Almost done.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.090
By the way,

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.090
you should hurry

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.200
and confirm the first draft
of the creative visuals.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.733
Okay, I'll go now.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.800
Thanks.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.860
Why didn't you tell me

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.066
about the in-stock problem?

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.266
It's already resolved.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:12.860
I didn't

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.010
mean that.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.222
We are now a team.

00:24:15.222 --> 00:24:16.810
If you encounter any difficulties,

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.377
you can...

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.180
We can all help you.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.980
In-stock is just a small matter.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.460
To win,

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.530
your creative proposal is the core.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.140
If you want to help me,

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.010
make the proposal perfect.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.488
I don't lead any imperfect proposals.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.090
Good.

00:24:48.711 --> 00:24:49.900
Bei'ao G-series new product's

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.133
creative marketing proposal

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.010
targets mainly middle-aged men.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.090
We build a driving-life,

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.140
fully in control

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.090
car brand image.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.010
Needs analysis,

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.140
pursuit of efficiency

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.220
and a safe, comfortable way to travel.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.700
The G-series cars mainly target

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.530
middle-aged men.

00:25:08.488 --> 00:25:09.940
Finally, in the conceptual design,

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.730
we used some of Bei'ao Motors'

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.810
components and elements
favored by the audience

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.140
to piece together the outline
of the G-series car.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.490
Also, to emphasize

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.700
full control.

00:25:20.955 --> 00:25:22.330
Director, we'll head out first.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:22.730
Okay.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:25.730
Mr. Wu,

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.290
that design just now

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.290
was really amazing.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.620
I feel that very soon,

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.980
we can sign a new round
of strategic cooperation.

00:25:32.355 --> 00:25:34.330
Thank you.
Looking forward to working together.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:35.377
Of course. Definitely.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:37.810
Cen is here.

00:25:38.444 --> 00:25:40.010
This time, AusStar got in unusually.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.390
Make sure to seize the opportunity.

00:25:41.622 --> 00:25:43.140
Thanks for your support, Mr. Chen.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.700
Then go in quickly.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.000
Everyone's waiting for you.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.980
Come, please sit.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:56.940
Ms. Shen.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.460
I'll prepare first.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.050
Okay.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.866
Hello, everyone.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.810
We are from AusStar.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:17.810
This time, we brought

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:18.490
Bei'ao Motors'

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:19.730
G-series marketing plan.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:20.860
The theme

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.266
is "Light of Dawn,
Master the Extraordinary".

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:46.220
(Execution strategy: TVC filming)

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:50.940
(Display method)

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.050
That concludes our

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.066
creative proposal.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.530
Any questions?

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.380
There's a line in the copy,

00:27:04.577 --> 00:27:06.490
"Make all obstacles
feel like smooth ground".

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:07.730
I quite like this idea.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:10.050
But I saw Ms. Cen mention

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.860
a place called Yunfeng Village.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.540
(Thanks for watching)

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:15.290
It's here.

00:27:16.266 --> 00:27:18.350
There are so many
remote mountainous areas in China.

00:27:18.355 --> 00:27:19.250
Why choose this one?

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.533
I'd never even heard of it.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.730
I conducted a field study there.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.140
Is it for our product?

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:24.980
Not entirely.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.290
My parents funded

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:27.090
the students there.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.090
The life and environment
in Yunfeng Village

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:31.090
are very natural,

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:31.730
very authentic.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.900
Its road conditions are also perfect

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.940
to showcase G-series'

00:27:34.955 --> 00:27:36.250
multi-terrain adaptation system.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.039
Because travel is inconvenient,

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.290
my parents visiting the students

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.980
they sponsor is difficult.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.860
But if they had a G-series,

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.050
I believe things
would be very different.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.810
A high-performance off-road vehicle

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:49.620
provides not only

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.380
convenience in travel,

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:53.220
but also a sense of culture

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.140
and sentiment,

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.490
and a deep, life-changing

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.290
experience of self-realization

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.420
that touches the heart.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.250
Have you considered

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.090
another possibility that, to the public,

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:06.530
this video may appear

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.010
as a tourism promo?

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.810
Focus on poverty alleviation,

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.180
not on our car.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.620
Rest assured.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.050
In the video,

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:17.460
90% of the clips

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.090
will directly or indirectly

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.377
be related to the G-series.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.900
So potential consumers

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.010
can experience the G-series'

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.490
full superior performance

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:25.660
from the inside out.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:29.330
Alright then.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.888
Let's leave it at that for today.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.940
Any updates later,

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.490
we'll notify AusStar immediately.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:34.660
Okay.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:36.133
Thanks, everyone.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.222
I'm leaving.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.330
Bye.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:49.711
You're not going home?

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.860
No one's home.

00:28:52.622 --> 00:28:54.177
There's still the school cafeteria.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.644
If I go home, I can't even get food.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.177
You weren't staying home
last week either.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:02.420
Your sister's back?

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.420
She's been super busy lately.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.355
I'll go home and change clothes.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:15.711
I'll be back later.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:19.940
Really?

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.755
Then I'll wait for you.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.259
Where shall we eat tonight?

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.244
It takes me an hour or two
to go back and forth.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:25.940
No worries.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.490
It's settled then.

00:29:27.533 --> 00:29:28.444
I am waiting for you.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:29.330
Okay.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.330
Okay.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.140
I'm leaving.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.466
Think about what to eat tonight.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:33.180
Okay.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.533
- You're back.
- You're back?

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.050
I was about to message you.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:44.420
I bought a hotpot base.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:45.911
We'll have hotpot at home tonight.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:48.770
Put your bag down.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.022
Wash your hands and eat.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:51.770
Okay.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.220
Why hasn't Li Wu come back yet?

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.090
Didn't he say he'd be back soon?

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.540
(Li Wu)

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.220
(Li Wu: Sorry.)

00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:21.733
(Not coming back tonight.)

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.044
(You can eat early.)

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:30.860
Eat more.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:35.330
Enough.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:36.290
It's piled high.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.660
You should eat more, okay?

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.250
The rest of the meat is yours.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:40.860
Must finish it.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:43.810
Okay.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.822
By the way,

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.660
I've been really busy recently,

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.859
and haven't communicated with you much.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.088
You're not upset, right?

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:04.860
No.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:07.530
Good.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.730
I finally finished the pitch.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.050
I'll have more free time afterward.

00:31:12.666 --> 00:31:14.220
If there's anything you want to do,

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:14.860
tell me.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.330
Actually...

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.977
I don't really have anything in mind.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.140
But I saw you were quite interested

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.180
in Artificial Intelligence before.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:40.090
We got

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:41.180
the Bei'ao Motors project.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.530
This is my first independent project

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:44.311
at the new company.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.380
Awesome!

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.533
We have to celebrate tonight.

00:31:46.955 --> 00:31:48.422
I also need to ask Chun Chang

00:31:48.422 --> 00:31:49.577
if she wants to come over.

00:31:49.711 --> 00:31:50.730
And tell my parents too.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.420
Hello.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.380
Chun Chang.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:57.770
We won.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.050
Wu Fu lost

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.090
in the Bei'ao Motors case.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:02.911
Let me tell you.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.266
Getting this pitch opportunity,

00:32:04.288 --> 00:32:05.940
and competing with Yiwen Creative Dream

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.140
was really not easy.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.090
You know we're

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:09.222
a very small company, right?

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.420
Flipping the odds this time

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.220
feels amazing.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:28.900
By the way,

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.090
this time, our ad

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.250
is set in Yunfeng Village.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:33.770
Really?

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.770
Do you have any places

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:38.900
that look especially good?

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:40.444
You can recommend some to me.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:45.250
Behind my grandfather's old house,

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.688
there's a winding mountain road.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.770
Go up along it.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.222
There's a peak called Qinglian Peak.

00:32:49.822 --> 00:32:51.311
I used to go there a lot as a kid.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.730
The view from the top is amazing.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.330
How's the road?

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.900
Can a car go up?

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.290
There is a road,

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.620
but it's not paved.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:01.810
Are you driving?

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:03.770
This fits

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:05.330
the theme of our project.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.090
I'll go and check

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.460
the actual road conditions.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:10.900
Can you see the sunrise there?

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.810
If we can shoot

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.050
some sunrise footage,

00:33:15.177 --> 00:33:16.010
that would be great.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:16.822
You can see it.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.810
And if you're lucky,

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.380
you can also see a sea of clouds.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.490
A sea of clouds?

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:23.940
That must be spectacular.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.140
Any other places?

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.490
Can you help me

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.700
make a reference list?

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:31.570
Sure.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:35.860
Wait a moment.

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:48.180
Go ahead.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.570
At sunrise and sunset,

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.330
the mountaintop often turns orange.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.330
Also, the terraced fields halfway up

00:33:57.844 --> 00:33:59.400
and the villages at the foot...

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.380
These colors

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.730
layer on top of each other.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.220
Looks like a painting.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:05.940
Also,

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:07.810
the mountain spring water

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.340
is crystal clear.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.860
In summer,

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.460
if you put freshly picked fruits

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.130
into it for a while and take them out,

00:34:14.288 --> 00:34:15.490
it's like they were chilled.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.650
And in the river,

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:22.690
there are

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.610
little fish, small crabs
and stuff like that.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.420
I remember my friends

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.170
often caught them,

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.666
fried them with flour and ate them.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:33.490
So fun.

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:36.470
♪Never retreated♪

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:37.010
Give me that.

West Mountain.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.420
There's also a small path.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:47.650
West Mountain is roughly

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.010
in this location.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.460
What's this?

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.170
West Mountain.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:54.570
This is West Mountain?

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:55.622
I didn't draw it very well.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.610
Anyway, West Mountain

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.380
has a small path here.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.260

(A new day, keep going too.)

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.355
Do we have New Year's Day off?

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.820
Yes.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.860
But what's the difference?

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.490
Look, even on a holiday,

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.210
we're still here, working overtime.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:35.490
Be careful.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.940
I'm still here.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:40.130
By the way,

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.460
I have a few

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.260
stand-up tickets

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:44.340
given by a client.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:46.170
It's for the hottest comedian lately.

00:36:46.288 --> 00:36:47.800
On the 2nd, anyone wants to go?

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.130
Stand-up comedy?

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.460
Not interested.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:53.820
Can I take two tickets?

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:55.300
Sure.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:57.260
Thanks.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.422
Anyone else?

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:00.130
Jin.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.900
Do you like stand-up comedy?

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:02.860
Not really.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:03.980
It's my brother's birthday.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.044
I want to take him.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.010
Why are you so nice to your brother?

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.300
Every day I see

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.210
my brother,

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:10.260
I just want to kick him.

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:12.170
Maybe it's because

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.733
he doesn't hang out in internet cafes.

00:37:13.733 --> 00:37:15.222
And his grades are top-notch.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:17.820
Oh, that hurts.

Are you home?

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:29.210
I just left school.

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.980
I'm at the bus stop.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.820

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:34.860
You're not home,

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:35.940
so I can study anywhere.
