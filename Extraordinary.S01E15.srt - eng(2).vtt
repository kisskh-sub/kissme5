00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.280
Sir

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:02.640
Sweetheart, sir

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.719
You're so annoying

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.719
Mischievous

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.560
Come on

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:17.599
Sir

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.599
Give it to me

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.200
Don't snatch

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.840
Mine

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.799
I'm right here

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:23.239
Here, sir

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.959
Give it to me

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.159
Come here

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:25.959
Sir

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.280
Mine, let go

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.159
Hand it over, it's mine

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:29.000
Give it to me

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.400
Give it to me

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:32.959
Mine

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:38.519
I grabbed it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.519
Sir

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:46.200
Sir, you're annoying

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.959
No, no

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:48.959
Everyone says no

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.400
Then you all teach us

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.439
What should we do

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.680
Your Majesty

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.000
It was Shi Feifan before

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.560
A blind cat caught a dead mouse

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.319
Vice Minister of Revenue is so important

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.840
He shouldn't get it at all

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.120
I have lived in Mou County for years

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.479
Your Majesty, I believe

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.280
Prince Qing is mistaken

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.080
Refugees are everywhere now

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.960
Sir Shi cares for the people

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.400
I think it's worth letting him try

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.240
As for the official post

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.560
It's fine to decide later

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.520
Princess, it's getting late

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.479
Your Majesty is waiting for you to return

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.080
Back in the day

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.360
Your mother and I felt the same

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.960
We couldn't bear to part for a moment

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.199
How you feel now

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.919
Your father understands

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:40.280
I get it

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.199
Shi Feifan

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.439
Your Majesty requests you

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.520
Congratulations, Sir Shi

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.919
What's there to congratulate

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.759
Your Majesty trusts Sir Shi to handle Mou County's refugees

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.560
If this succeeds

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.839
It will be a great service to the nation

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:20.759
Refugees

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.079
It's your wrongdoing

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.680
It must be you, old scoundrel

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:29.399
You

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:32.199
Sir Shi, the Prime Minister means well

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.399
You've really lucked out

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:38.639
I believe

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.920
With Sir Shi's skills

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.639
He can surely handle the refugee issue

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.120
I'm waiting for your promotion banquet

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:52.720
You sly old scoundrel

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.240
Now you drop the act

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:56.839
Throwing this hot potato to me

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.879
And still want to freeload at my house

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.000
Outrageous

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.240
Who's this barking dog now

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.839
You

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.120
Step aside

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.959
Your Majesty

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.279
My dear Shi, you arrived just in time

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.240
We wanted to grant you Vice Minister of Revenue

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.480
But all the ministers opposed

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.160
We can't rule alone

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.160
Or hurt the officials' feelings

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.879
Besides, my dear Shi

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:40.199
You still need more experience

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.360
Achieve more accomplishments

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.839
Then even if some oppose

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:46.480
We can stand up for you

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.079
Your Majesty wants me to handle the refugees

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.879
Exactly

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.639
Forgive me, Your Majesty

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.439
I'm afraid I can't obey

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.319
Your Majesty, have you forgotten

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:07.480
My Ling Gou Official post

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:08.439
You already dismissed me

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.040
Now I hold no office

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.199
I'm just a commoner

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.920
Hard to take on such a task

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.600
That's easy to fix

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.839
Send our decree

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:21.560
The people of Mou County

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.319
Will they believe Your Majesty sent

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.839
A commoner with no official post

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:27.360
Your Majesty

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.120
I can't explain myself

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.160
And you won't even grant me a post

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:33.079
Your Majesty

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.839
Maybe you don't truly trust me

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:38.680
It's because of your past misdeeds

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:39.680
Any one of them

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.040
Could be used against you

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.519
If not for that

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.519
Prime Minister Lü wouldn't keep hounding you

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.439
Let him hound me, it's fine

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.680
As long as Your Majesty gives me one thing

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.720
We don't have it

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.199
No, you do

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.759
And only you have it

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.759
What

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.319
You want our throne now?

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.879
This Imperial Sword is so heavy

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:25.000
Prime Minister Lü, please rise

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:29.240
Man is iron, food is steel

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:32.079
Without food, can't lift the sword

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.959
Prime Minister Lü won't be mad, right?

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.079
Prime Minister Lü, do you know

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.000
This Imperial Sword grants execute first, report later

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.439
I heard Your Majesty say

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.600
It can slay a foolish ruler

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:51.120
Or a treacherous minister

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:53.560
This sword has a little quirk

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:57.279
It hates those who boast of their merits

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:59.079
And sly, petty schemers

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:06.240
Heaven sees what people do

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:09.720
No wall in the world is airtight

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:11.680
I advise you, Prime Minister Lü

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:13.759
Do less harm to others

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.720
Leave some virtue for your descendants

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:26.000
Shi Feifan, don't push me too far.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.680
Don't be mad, don't be mad.

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:29.959
Prime Minister Lü.

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:33.159
If Prime Minister Lü doesn't mind,

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.519
let me be your godfather.

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:40.840
If you need help, your godfather's got you.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.200
Shi Feifan.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:45.840
The road ahead is long and winding.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.679
Take care on your journey.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:50.960
Thank you for your concern.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.720
Prime Minister Lü,

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:56.200
after I met you,

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:57.120
I realized

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:59.440
how ugly human nature can truly be.

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:02.440
But I, Shi Feifan, never hold grudges.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.559
I always settle scores right away.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.159
Face soldiers with generals, floods with earth.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.240
No one in the Shi family has ever feared anyone.

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:13.639
Let's have fish together sometime.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.039
You sure know how to nitpick.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.159
You're out of your mind.

00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:22.759
How could you be an official if you weren't?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.039
Isn't this way more fun than games?

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.600
A real-life senior official role.

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.559
Take care, Prime Minister Lü.

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:08.679
I'll make sure they can't escape my grasp.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.720
They won't see tomorrow's sun.

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:13.039
Yes, sir.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.039
Yue Ying,

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:20.080
has her own plans.

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:21.960
Just in case,

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.799
go secretly to Mou County at once.

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:25.480
Find Nan Batian.

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.480
Deal with that Shi kid for me.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.000
How should I do it?

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:33.440
I don't need to teach you, do I?

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.759
Yes.

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:08.720
Can't wait any longer, huh?

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.240
Looks like this trip will be fruitful.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.600
Father.

00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:20.759
Feifan.

00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:34.960
Your grandfather's sword.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.600
I wanted you to carry it for protection.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.840
Turns out Your Majesty thought of everything.

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:42.039
Come.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.519
Let's have a few drinks together.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.559
Come, Father.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.279
The Emperor would never give it to me.

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.120
Besides,

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:57.879
I've got a Gatling for protection.

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:00.759
The Imperial Sword is just for show.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.240
Feifan.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.519
Mou County borders Qiang Country.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.159
It's remote, full of all sorts of people.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.159
Disasters happen there often.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.879
The court sends tens of thousands in relief funds yearly.

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:20.240
But it never changes the people's misery.

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:34.679
Those relief funds

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:36.679
probably end up in others' pockets.

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:38.279
That's right.

00:12:40.039 --> 00:12:42.080
Prime Minister Lü strongly recommended you this time.

00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:44.799
It can't be as simple as it seems.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.120
I hear Mou County's magistrate is tough.

00:12:56.679 --> 00:12:59.720
You must be very careful, my son.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.080
Never act rashly.

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:17.279
Father.

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:19.559
I never fight unprepared battles.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.559
Come.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.440
Father.

00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:38.440
No matter if it's a mountain of blades or a sea of fire ahead,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.639
or a bottomless abyss,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.039
I must go to Mou County.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.200
Good.

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:45.159
My son has ambition.

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:46.879
Come, let's drink.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.320
By the way, Father,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.799
fifteen years ago,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.799
the case of Governor of Shu Province, General Ren Gengyao—

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.960
Was there any evidence found later

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.399
proving General Ren betrayed the country?

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:17.240
No.

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:21.360
Then who accused General Ren of treason back then?

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.080
Anonymous report.

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:27.399
Feifan, why are you asking this?

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:30.000
Just curious.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.039
I was fighting outside at the time.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.720
Didn't know he was killed in Mou County.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.080
General Ren—

00:14:46.159 --> 00:14:48.639
He was a loyal servant of our dynasty.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.039
What a pity.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.039
No evidence to clear his name.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.519
Father.

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.320
A loyal minister like General Ren—

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:25.759
Father.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.320
Father.

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:31.639
This old man

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.759
is down after just a few drinks.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.879
Even a tough man has a gentle side.
