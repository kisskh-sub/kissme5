00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.430
I've never had a drink

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.160
with the recently deceased Chairman.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.120
A little girl?

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.280
Try to survive for a year.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.000
If you die by my sword,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.950
I'll drink to you.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:45.880
That's because you're

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.880
the 100th Xiangshui Gang man

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.400
to die by my sword.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.190
The Ma Gang had twenty petty disputes

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.400
with the Chamber of Commerce's men,

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.000
and we won nineteen.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.000
I've killed not so many of you,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.400
but I think

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.040
you're next.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.790
Old man.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.790
You'd better watch your health

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.190
and try to live a few more years

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.400
to live long enough to fight me.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.790
What did you say?

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.790
Little girl.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.430
The road to hell doesn't care about age.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.240
Remember.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.310
This is Xichuan.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.790
The fist is the boss.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.520
Guys.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.550
Let's go.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.240
Che.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.950
Why are you leaving?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.480
You haven't eaten yet.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.310
There's no poison in these dishes.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.760
What's going on?

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.710
I've received information

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.310
that we're evenly matched with Ma Gang.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:58.910
Madam.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.040
You don't know

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.790
that Ma Gang's people

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.790
are brutal killers.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.550
They have no regard for life in a war.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.950
Not only that,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.240
there is now a clinic

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.550
in their territory,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.760
headed by a doctor named Fu Sheng.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.160
He is an excellent healer.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.280
Anyone who is still breathing

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:19.950
can be revived

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.070
at his place,

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.070
so Ma Gang's people are even less afraid of death now.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.040
When fighting,

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.360
they often cause a double loss,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.830
like mad dogs.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.950
I'm worried about our men getting hurt

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.590
or even losing their lives for nothing,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.610
so based on the current situation,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.310
we're trying to avoid conflict

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.430
and endure as much as possible.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.950
I want to see what Fu Sheng

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.040
is so capable of

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.360
that he can sway a city.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.830
Don't.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.550
Fu Sheng's leader is the daughter

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.910
of the city lord, Wen Jue.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.640
He's powerful now.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.160
I have my ways.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:57.590
Yin Lie.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.710
Let's go.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:14.670
Siming.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.710
They're all gone.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:17.950
Shall we continue eating?

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:18.710
Of course.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.120
Why not?

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.190
We'll eat and watch the show.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.520
What show?

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.400
It's called

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.360
A Treacherous Woman vs an Old Mad Dog.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.060
Damn.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.520
She's a tough one.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.480
Should I

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.360
ask someone to kill her?

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.550
Forget it.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.280
Guo Sishui just arrived,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.520
so we don't know what she is.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.160
We'd better be careful.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:54.950
I'm afraid this person

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.520
looks more difficult to deal with than Sun Siming.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.320
Don't worry.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.550
The most important thing now

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.310
is to build up our strength.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.040
Nothing else matters.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.520
Let's see what this woman wants first.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.550
We can't fight

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.830
if she doesn't offend us.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.430
Yes.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.240
Does this deserve your praise?

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:42.910
Your archery is good,

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.070
but that's common

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.360
in the army.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.430
It's rare

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.430
that Lord Wen's soldiers

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:51.880
can keep their eyes

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.070
and minds still

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:53.910
when there's a noise.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.310
They are really good soldiers.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.670
Chairman Guo,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.480
you didn't come here

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.520
just to praise my soldiers, did you?

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.070
That's right, Lord Wen.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.160
I came here to talk to you

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.120
about the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.520
For so many years,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.640
as the Lord of Xichuan,

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.120
I have never favored

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.480
or helped any party.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.710
So today, what is it that

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.710
you want to discuss with me?

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.670
Before I came to Xichuan,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.190
I also thought that you were not biased,

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.070
but after I came, I found

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.830
that the clinic opened by your daughter

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.760
has a good relationship with Ma Gang.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.190
It's just my daughter's hobby.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.520
What's wrong?

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:46.400
Is it

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.550
in your way?

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.880
The Chamber of Commerce and Ma Gang have been

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.910
getting along for many years and evenly matched.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.000
Now, we have lost two Chairmen

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.310
in a row

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.950
and are in a period of turmoil,

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.430
but Ma Gang has taken advantage of the situation

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:04.550
and continues to nuisance the Chamber of Commerce.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.360
Chairman Guo.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:07.950
You've said all this,

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.310
but I still don't know

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.000
if the Chamber of Commerce's heavy losses

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.910
have anything to do with my daughter.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:16.790
It surely does.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.000
Your daughter's clinic

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.950
is treating Ma Gang's injuries

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.760
and upsetting the balance of Xichuan.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.790
Lord Wen, please look at the big picture

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:27.790
and shut down the clinic.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:30.880
Chairman Guo.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.520
Can I

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.480
take your words

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.310
as a threat?

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.830
I wouldn't dare. Please don't misunderstand.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.640
I'm straight

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.310
and don't use euphemisms,

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.710
but I didn't mean to threaten you.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.430
Which of my hands

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.160
is the Wuzhu coin in?

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.120
Sometimes, seeing is not believing.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.480
You don't have to stand out when you do something.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.590
Understand?

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.160
I'm just a soldier.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.910
No.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.430
You're a smart man.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:44.760
In Xichuan,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.190
only smart people can live well.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.670
Consider this coin

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.880
a gift from me to you.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:54.950
See you.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.350
Your Excellency, great.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.550
You convinced that rascal with just one magic trick.

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:15.720
I wanted to shock the young woman

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.590
by shooting the arrow

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.350
into the square hole of the coin.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.040
But then...

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.830
I missed,

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:29.070
so I was just bluffing.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.150
Your Excellency, you're brilliant.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:40.790
He's so treacherous.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.310
Why?

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.500
With the Wuzhu coin, he reminded me that businessmen talk business.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.560
Now that I've come to the Jibei Chamber of Commerce,

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.590
I can no longer act like a soldier.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.760
It's too tiring to talk to someone who doesn't speak normally.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.390
We can't understand him.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.590
Where are we going now?

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.790
To the clinic.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.870
Since businessmen talk business,

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.480
we can't just do business in one place.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.240
Vice Chairman Guo, please wait.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.440
Who are you?

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:07.720
My name is Fu Sheng,

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:08.830
the doctor at Wenfu Hall.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.790
You are Fu Sheng?

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:10.830
Have you heard of me?

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.200
What do you want with me?

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.540
Some time ago,

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.000
I saw you leading the army into the city.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.200
Can you lend me one of those masks

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.240
that the soldiers wear?

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.070
What do you need that for?

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.040
Have you heard of Hole Ghost?

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.590
A little bit.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.790
A few days ago, Hole Ghost stole a child.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.920
I tracked him all the way to the West Woods

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.350
but was stopped by the poisonous fog.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.440
I was hoping you could do me a favor.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.440
You don't have to give it back.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:43.960
Yin Lie.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.920
You said there's a tavern here

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.870
with the most flavorful wine.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.920
Take me there.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:49.960
I can understand this.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.680
Let's drink.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.830
Master, what are you looking at?

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.680
A few rags.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.390
Hulu.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.240
Can you see the mystery in this cloth?

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.680
Aren't these just a few rags?

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.350
That's all on the surface.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.830
These pieces of cloth appear to have been randomly stacked,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.550
but in fact,

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.240
they're arranged in a certain order.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.630
What order?

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.520
Well,

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.000
your master has gone to his fairyland again.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.350
Fu Sheng, do you have any humanity?

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.720
Did you ask me to gather wood for you

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.440
just to make smoked duck?

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.150
Let me ask you.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.790
Which part of you feels the worst when there's smoke?

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:59.630
All parts.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.280
I feel like my nose and throat are being stabbed.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.480
The reason the border army masks hold up against the elements is because,

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.200
I think, the layers of fabric

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.680
are woven differently.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.630
Burlap is the roughest and has the largest gaps.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.200
Silk is the finest and has the smallest gaps.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.680
The inner layer of fabric is finer

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.830
than the outer layer,

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.960
so when the border army soldiers wear this mask

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.550
through the wind and sand,

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.590
each layer can block the dust.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.480
So

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.920
the soldiers can breathe freely.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.350
I seem to understand.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.630
Don't talk about my master like that.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.830
My master is an extraordinary man,

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.070
unlike laymen like you.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.680
No.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.610
You haven't seen him

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.830
shoving everything into his mouth on the street.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.520
That's what makes him

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.000
extraordinary.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.520
I've got an idea.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:13.830
Gu Tian.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.200
This is my new mask.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.000
Try it for me.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.150
Why don't you?

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.590
I've inhaled too much poisonous mist.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.390
Share it with me.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:21.790
Come on.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.200
Gosh.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.720
How's it going?

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.000
It doesn't work.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.110
It seems the rough linen

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.520
can only keep out the wind and sand.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.390
What kind of material

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.070
would keep out the poisonous mist?

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:03.520
No.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.040
I can't stand this stuff.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.960
Let's go back.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:27.680
Water.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.630
What's wrong with water?

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.520
It's clearing up.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.960
The water's really clearing up.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.000
So...

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.790
Please.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.550
I won't try it in the poisonous fog.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:05.790
Try it yourself.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.440
Okay.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.310
Later, if I'm poisoned,

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.440
stab the Baihui acupuncture on top of my head with a golden needle.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.480
Remember. Steady and slow.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.040
Well,

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.720
let me do it.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:20.680
Thank you.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.830
Oh, my God.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.720
Let's go.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.040
Come on.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.280
How's it going?

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.390
No problem.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.350
No problem?

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.000
Did I make it?

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:55.480
I see.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.350
This is where it fogged up last time, right?

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.830
Maybe.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:14.720
Then let's go in.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.830
This time, we'll get the Mountain-shaped jade

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.720
and find the baby.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.110
Let's go.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:53.720
Let's go.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.830
Are we going the wrong way?

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:09.240
Listen.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.310
That way.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.150
Is there a trap?

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.040
The baby's still in there.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.630
Do we have a choice?

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.160
Don't worry.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.750
It'll be over in a minute.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.750
When will this be over?

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:13.670
Keep your voice down.

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.070
Are you saying it's raw?

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.540
[Qin Miao, Witch Doctor]

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.030
The first drumbeat prays for well-being.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:48.590
The second brings good fortune.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.440
The third prolongs happiness.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.960
With the blessing of the gods, the clan prospers.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.160
We honor the gods with sincerity.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.590
Peace and joy will remain forever.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.400
I don't feel right.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.440
What are they trying to do to the child?

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.720
We can't wait any longer.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.640
Let's save the child.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.440
You guys save the kid.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.270
I'll take care of the rest.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:10.750
OK.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.590
Luckily, the kid's fine.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.720
Wait.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.640
I'm sorry for the scare.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.200
We didn't know an outsider

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.770
had broken through the mist and interrupted the blessing.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.550
Forgive me.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.590
Ask them what they're doing here.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.830
I'll punish you later.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.560
Who are you guys?

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.680
We two run a clinic,

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.550
not worth mentioning,

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.230
but this girl is something else.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.070
Xichuan's Young Mistress, Wen Jue.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.240
If you guys dare to hurt her today,

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.400
within a few hours,

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.750
Xichuan's army

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.640
will level this shabby fortress.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.830
This could be a misunderstanding.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.030
I don't think so.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.880
You stole this child

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.200
from the slums, didn't you?

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.200
I saw with my own eyes that you were going to hurt him.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.070
The boy in your hands is one of our people.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.000
We are not harming him

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:16.570
but saving him.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.440
How dare you say you're saving him

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.680
after what you did to him?

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.070
Of course, we are saving him.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.930
Master, have mercy

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.020
and save this child.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.310
Blessed water.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.330
This is an acute case.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.870
If not treated in time,

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:34.360
his life will be in danger.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.570
God's blessing heals all.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.350
No.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.600
The cause of the disease has yet to be determined,

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.510
so how can you just give a child medicine?

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.270
What will happen if he takes the medicine?

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.960
He will...

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.070
He will be cured.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.980
Thank you, masters.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.400
How did you do it?

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.510
You saw it with your own eyes.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.160
It was a blessing from God.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.200
Isn't that just a pot?

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.550
How dare you desecrate a holy thing?

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.000
Take them all away

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.920
and wait for my order.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:23.750
Let's go.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.720
The boy is...

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:27.970
Come on.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:31.850
Why did

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.590
those witches' medicine work so well?

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.310
Don't think about that.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.440
We should think about how to get out of here.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.640
Guys, are you hungry?

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.720
Have some food.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.920
Just these?

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.510
You have no respect for us.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.790
Even death row prisoners eat better than this.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.070
You've got me all wrong.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.640
I mean you no harm.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.070
But I'm curious

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.720
as to who you are

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.030
and why you're stealing babies from the city.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.600
We began as babies

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.680
abandoned in the woods by slumlords

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.200
and struggled to grow up.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.850
Over the centuries,

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.340
we have become a small clan.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.840
Most of us were born weak and sickly,

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.750
but thanks to the mercy of the gods,

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.920
we were able to survive on mountain food

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.350
and grew up to be known

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.270
as the Tianyi tribe.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.590
I am the current Chief.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.720
The boy's name is Tian Gou.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.420
He was born looking like a beast.

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.830
Seeing that he was athletic,

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.750
Heavenly Tutor taught him martial arts.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.600
For over a decade, he's been searching

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.690
for new blood for the tribe.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.080
You'd ruin

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.920
other families

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.000
to keep your tribe alive?

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:00.200
Why would you do that?

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.280
We will only take in weak and sickly children

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.680
who have been abandoned by poor families.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.030
Have you not tried to get a physician

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:08.830
to treat them?

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.720
It costs a lot of money to have a healer in the city,

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:17.590
and no one is willing to heal us for free,

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.310
so we dismissed the idea of going back to the city

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.790
and decided to struggle to survive here in the forest.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.830
More than ten years ago,

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.660
three masters discovered this place.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.160
They prayed to the gods

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.680
for blessings to heal our people

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.340
and show us a new direction.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.400
Masters?

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.680
I know you don't like those Masters,

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.270
but those three Masters have

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:48.510
great skill and true power.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.720
If you do not want to befriend them,

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.510
please do not offend them

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.720
and leave here as soon as possible.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.000
No problem.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.920
We will leave immediately

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.830
after you return the child to us.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.960
After the children outside

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.750
are brought to the Tianyi tribe,

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.240
they have to stay in the master's house for seven days.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.570
The Master will use Heaven Soup

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.720
to remove the toxins from the children's bodies.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.720
After seven days,

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.200
the children who survived can only be raised by the tribe,

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:25.110
or the tribe will die when they are contaminated with this poison.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.720
Why do children who are fine die

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.510
when they get to him?

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.960
It was not their fault.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.120
The residual toxin has entered their heart chakra.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.920
There's no way to save them.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.920
Don't worry. I'm here to make a promise.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.640
As long as the boy makes it out of Master's house alive,

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.790
we'll take good care of him

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.960
so he can grow up healthy.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.240
If you believe me,

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.440
I'll ask Tian Gou to take you out of here.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.480
Chief.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:03.550
I want to see

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.680
what the three Heavenly Tutors are capable of,

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.110
so can you let us stay for a few more days?

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.350
If you want to stay, I won't say no,

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.790
but please don't offend

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:18.070
and disappoint those masters.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.070
Thank you very much.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:22.240
Let's go.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.160
Chief.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.310
Have you ever seen a piece of the Mountain-shaped jade?

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.550
It's getting late.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.270
Get some rest.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.750
Are they really making the so-called Heaven Soup?

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:04.270
Who?

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.150
Damn civet cat.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:11.360
I'll kill you sooner or later.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.510
Don't cry.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:17.630
Or I'll boil you.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.230
If I didn't imitate a cat's cry quick-wittedly,

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.800
I wouldn't be able to come back now.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.320
Don't be modest.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.400
You're such a good fighter,

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.960
so how come you're stuck with a witch doctor?

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.110
I like that.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.960
Not to mention one,

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.440
even if there were ten of them, I could still escape.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.920
Tian Xiu says they're de-poisoning the kids,

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:44.320
but I don't believe him.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.320
What exactly

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.030
is Qin Miao doing to the children?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.150
I propose

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.670
we stay and continue to investigate.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.630
I object.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.320
I agree.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.230
You are worthy of being my friend.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.710
You immediately agreed to my objection.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.510
Since there are two votes against,

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:00.440
let's go now.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.880
What I'm saying is

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.470
that I agree with Wen Jue's proposal

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.020
and stay here to continue the investigation.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.360
We must know

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.710
why Qin Miao keeps that kid.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.360
Looks like Chief was right last night.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.840
Most of the Tianyi tribe

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.920
are disabled.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.760
Please be seated.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.230
I didn't treat you well yesterday,

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.110
so I've prepared

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.920
some Tianyi tribe specialties

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.710
for you today.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:52.880
The food here is definitely not as refined as in town,

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.630
but it's original,

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.840
so please don't mind.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.840
Thank you, Chief.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.670
Have you ever had

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.230
Master Qin's blessed water?

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:09.840
It seems you are still skeptical about masters.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:11.760
Chief, you're worrying too much.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.670
The three of us accidentally

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.960
got a cold last night,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.110
so...

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.680
In fact,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.840
we saw

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.410
these masters' power yesterday

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.330
and learned the efficacy of blessed water,

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.880
so we want to ask for a few bowls of blessed water

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.780
to get rid of the disease in our bodies.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.280
Okay.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.710
God's blessing is only effective

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.880
for those who are weak,

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.650
so I'm afraid

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.800
you're not qualified to drink it yet.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.400
Master, what are you doing here?

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.880
I wanted to see how you

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.730
treat these outsiders behind my back.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.670
Please don't say that.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.880
I'm just being kind to guests.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:02.510
What's wrong with you?

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.360
Tian Yu.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.090
Tian Yu had another attack.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.740
What's wrong?

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:15.880
It's croup.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:26.670
Hey.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.760
Why are you stopping me?

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.230
The people of the Tianyi tribe should be treated by a witch doctor.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.620
Their sorcery will anger the gods.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.330
If you get involved in their sorcery,

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.360
the gods will abandon you

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.400
and never give you a favor again.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.030
Old fool, you're threatening us.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:46.670
This is not a threat

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.400
but the choice of the Tianyi tribe.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.880
All right. If you can heal,

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.760
you go.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.920
Go.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.030
Nonsense.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.950
I, as a disciple, have recourse to a fairy child.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.000
The calamity is in this feast.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.480
With no other choice...

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.800
Hurry, he's dying.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:29.030
God's blessing heals all.

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:52.480
If you keep healing like this, he'll die.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.110
Let go.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:55.920
Sit up.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:57.670
Breathe in.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.510
Breathe out.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.230
Breathe in.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:02.920
Breathe out.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.630
Come on, follow my rhythm.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.230
Breathe out.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:11.920
Breathe in.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.150
Breathe in.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:16.400
Breathe out.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.630
Take a big breath.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.510
Breathe out.

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:23.000
Feeling better?

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:25.480
Remember.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.590
This is croup.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.780
Don't go to such dusty places

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.510
or cook

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.110
over a fire.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.800
Eat less salt and exercise more.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.960
That way, you'll have fewer relapses in the future.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
The spirit returns.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.480
The god came down and drove away this sick spirit.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.840
Why are you still talking nonsense?

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.800
He was clearly cured by Fu Sheng.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.590
Right?

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.440
Answer me.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:59.280
No.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.760
No.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.150
It was divine power.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.150
The gods came down

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.030
and gave this young man health.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.480
The demons in this young man

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.550
were too persistent,

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.400
so the divine power took effect late.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.150
In the past few days,

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.440
everyone has seen it.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.360
Fu Sheng has been treating

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.150
but not using medicine,

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.960
so how can he cure the patient?

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.000
It's me.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.030
I invited the god.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.630
Thank you, God.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.920
Okay.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.150
You're even better at telling lies

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.920
than I am.
