(Episode 10)

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:36.607
But...

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:39.376
I have one question.

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:41.979
What is it?

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:44.648
What was your mother trying to say...

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:46.917
that day?

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:49.653
Can you tell me?

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:57.427
It's nothing.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.465
Now that things ended up like this,
she probably just wanted...

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.268
to make excuses.

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:09.673
But I'm glad you're here.

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:11.875
I was actually going to ask
to see you anyway.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.611
Wait.

00:01:32.062 --> 00:01:33.096
What's this?

00:01:33.664 --> 00:01:34.464
Open it.

00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:52.849
Honey, aren't those pretty?

00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:54.952
Yeah, they are.

00:01:56.386 --> 00:01:58.689
Can you buy those for me
as a birthday present?

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:04.628
You asked me to buy those for you
a long time ago.

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:07.831
But back then, I thought
you'd run away if I bought you shoes.

00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:08.932
So I couldn't.

00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:13.837
But I don't have
to worry about that anymore.

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:18.275
And...

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:22.546
you can take this house.

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:26.783
The divorce is 100 percent my fault,

00:02:26.783 --> 00:02:28.051
so it's only right
that you keep this place.

00:02:29.486 --> 00:02:31.088
I'll find somewhere else to live.

00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:34.191
From now on,
you can stay here and be comfortable.

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:40.697
I've done so many awful things to you
all this time.

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:43.333
I'm sorry I couldn't make you happy.

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:45.802
Forget a pathetic man like me.

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:50.307
I hope you meet a decent man,

00:02:54.044 --> 00:02:55.412
and be happy again.

00:03:06.857 --> 00:03:07.758
Min Woo and Min Jun.

00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:10.560
You have to listen
to Mom and Grandpa, okay?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.029
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:03:12.496 --> 00:03:14.364
I'll come every weekend,

00:03:14.364 --> 00:03:15.766
so even if you miss me, hang in there.

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:16.767
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:17.935
Give me a hug.

00:03:18.902 --> 00:03:20.837
My boys.

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.745
Dad, I know it'll be hard,
but please look after them.

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:29.947
And please take care of your health too.

00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:32.482
All right, don't you worry.

00:03:33.116 --> 00:03:36.186
You be careful too,
so you don't wear yourself out.

00:03:36.186 --> 00:03:37.120
Yes.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.823
Don't worry about us. Good luck.

00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:43.794
I'll sort that matter out somehow.

00:03:44.294 --> 00:03:45.262
Just trust me.

00:03:45.862 --> 00:03:48.532
All right,
but don't push yourself too hard.

00:03:48.532 --> 00:03:50.400
When I come on the weekend, let's work
through everything one step at a time.

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:51.868
Okay.

00:03:51.868 --> 00:03:52.803
I'll get going.

00:03:53.403 --> 00:03:54.638
Dad, I'm heading out now.

00:03:55.138 --> 00:03:56.807
All right, off you go.

00:03:57.541 --> 00:03:59.076
Min Woo, Min Jun, I'm going now.

00:03:59.076 --> 00:04:02.112
Dad, don't go.

00:04:02.112 --> 00:04:04.147
I have to.
I'll come on my days off.

00:04:06.617 --> 00:04:08.785
This jacket you're looking at right now...

00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:10.787
isn't so thin that it loses its shape,

00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:13.457
but it's not too thick either.
It's right in between.

00:04:13.457 --> 00:04:17.527
So when you wear it over a suit,
it looks neat and luxurious.

00:04:17.527 --> 00:04:18.662
You see?

00:04:18.662 --> 00:04:20.731
It keeps the shoulder line sharp,

00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:22.099
and it really shapes your silhouette.

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.234
The fit is absolutely stunning.

00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:26.203
You're wearing a size S right now, right?

00:04:26.203 --> 00:04:27.471
Right.

00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:30.207
Because the waistline nips in
slightly like this,

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:31.775
it makes your body look a bit slimmer.

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:33.010
Song Ye Na should...

00:04:33.377 --> 00:04:37.047
I noticed something weird
when I looked at the lineup this morning.

00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:37.981
Song Ye Na was listed...

00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:40.918
as the main primetime show host.

00:04:40.918 --> 00:04:44.121
So I was wondering...

00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:45.923
how she landed that spot.

00:04:45.923 --> 00:04:46.757
Wait.

00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:49.626
What if...

00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:52.262
she just fell
for the executive director's offer...

00:04:52.262 --> 00:04:53.597
of the primetime segment?

00:04:58.502 --> 00:05:00.270
Who's that show host
who suddenly popped up?

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.706
I liked
"Kim Yu Ra's Power Must-Have" better.

00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:04.975
Ye Na's jacket is fine,

00:05:04.975 --> 00:05:07.311
but it feels like she's trying
to outshine the jacket herself.

00:05:07.311 --> 00:05:08.312
It's a bit off-putting.

00:05:08.312 --> 00:05:09.713
Does she have connections or what?

00:05:09.713 --> 00:05:11.248
Why did the host suddenly change?

00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:14.318
I think primetime calls for someone
with more experience.

00:05:18.922 --> 00:05:20.357
Ye Na, we should talk.

00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:23.226
Sorry, but I'm a little busy right now.

00:05:23.226 --> 00:05:24.928
Should we talk in front of people?

00:05:26.063 --> 00:05:26.997
Is that okay?

00:05:29.032 --> 00:05:31.602
What is this about?

00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:35.172
Why did you tell such ridiculous lies
to the Ethics Committee?

00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:38.909
Seon Min and Producer Noh are not
having an affair.

00:05:39.576 --> 00:05:41.345
You know that better than anyone.

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:45.015
What are you talking about? Lies?

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.386
I get that you don't want to believe it,

00:05:50.153 --> 00:05:51.421
but it's all true.

00:05:52.422 --> 00:05:54.891
I don't think this is something
you should be saying to me.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.127
I know you're desperate to survive,
no matter what.

00:05:57.628 --> 00:05:58.829
I'm not oblivious to that.

00:05:59.162 --> 00:06:01.265
But how could you,
as someone who was hurt too,

00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:03.800
turn around and frame Producer Noh,
who was trying to help Seon Min?

00:06:04.268 --> 00:06:07.237
Did you get into primetime
in exchange for lying for them?

00:06:07.237 --> 00:06:08.238
Or...

00:06:08.238 --> 00:06:10.741
did someone tempt you
with promises of success?

00:06:10.741 --> 00:06:12.476
What are you even talking about right now?

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.845
And who exactly is the victim here?

00:06:17.281 --> 00:06:20.684
I don't know what Producer Noh told you,

00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:23.287
but I am absolutely not a victim.

00:06:23.687 --> 00:06:24.688
The primetime segment.

00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:27.391
I earned that with my skills
and my own hard work.

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:30.060
Why are you insulting me
with baseless assumptions?

00:06:31.561 --> 00:06:32.496
Then...

00:06:33.096 --> 00:06:34.831
why were you crying in front of Seon Min?

00:06:35.299 --> 00:06:37.167
And what did you mean
when you said you were scared?

00:06:39.503 --> 00:06:42.606
Can't a senior visit a junior
in the hospital?

00:06:42.606 --> 00:06:43.540
You're really blowing this
out of proportion.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.009
Ye Na, please just be honest with me.

00:06:47.578 --> 00:06:50.314
Producer Noh helped you a lot
when you were a rookie.

00:06:51.148 --> 00:06:52.983
When the seniors were trying to crush you,

00:06:52.983 --> 00:06:55.285
he stood by you and looked out for you.
Have you already forgotten that?

00:06:57.187 --> 00:06:58.322
This is really getting on my nerves.

00:06:59.256 --> 00:07:01.992
How much help did I really get anyway?

00:07:01.992 --> 00:07:04.328
You're dragging up ancient history
and ticking me off.

00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:29.653
So when is he coming in, exactly?

00:07:29.653 --> 00:07:31.421
I said, I don't know.

00:07:31.421 --> 00:07:32.856
How many times do I have to say
I don't know?

00:07:32.856 --> 00:07:35.626
Does it make any sense that he hasn't
shown up at the office even once?

00:07:35.626 --> 00:07:37.794
That's up to the boss.

00:07:37.794 --> 00:07:39.329
Why are you taking it out on us?

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.633
Then at least tell me where he lives.

00:07:42.633 --> 00:07:44.134
I'll wait and talk to him.

00:07:45.002 --> 00:07:47.337
I can't talk to this woman.

00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:51.808
The boss said he doesn't want to see you.

00:07:52.676 --> 00:07:53.744
Enough.

00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:55.512
Stop disrupting our business.
Please leave.

00:07:55.512 --> 00:07:57.347
I have something to say to the boss.

00:07:57.347 --> 00:07:59.383
If you keep this up,
I'm calling the police.

00:07:59.383 --> 00:08:00.684
Get out now.

00:08:00.684 --> 00:08:02.085
- Just a second.
- Out. Now!

00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:03.987
- Wait.
- Just get out already!

00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:22.039

00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:46.830
Welcome.

00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:49.399
Hello.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.537
Mr. Kang Jong Ryeol
is a member here, right?

00:08:54.304 --> 00:08:55.172
Who's asking?

00:08:55.505 --> 00:08:56.506
It's nothing big.

00:08:57.274 --> 00:08:59.743
I'm the owner of a place
he used to come to a lot.

00:09:00.477 --> 00:09:03.247
He ran up a tab there,
and then stopped coming.

00:09:03.614 --> 00:09:06.183
I tried calling, but he never picked up.

00:09:06.183 --> 00:09:07.818
Then I heard he comes here often,

00:09:07.818 --> 00:09:09.653
so I thought maybe I could catch him here.

00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:14.157
But I can't help you out
with anything here.

00:09:14.157 --> 00:09:16.193
If Mr. Kang comes here,

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:18.495
could you just send me a quick text?

00:09:18.495 --> 00:09:19.896
I'll take care of the rest myself.

00:09:21.131 --> 00:09:22.466
And also,

00:09:26.703 --> 00:09:28.205
this one.

00:09:28.205 --> 00:09:29.973
Here.

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:34.144
Hey.

00:09:34.444 --> 00:09:38.215
Why not fire him
instead of just demoting him?

00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:41.318
You could've cut him loose from the start.

00:09:41.318 --> 00:09:42.819
Why did you let this blow up?

00:09:43.587 --> 00:09:45.155
Be quiet.

00:09:45.155 --> 00:09:46.957
If you don't know
what you're talking about, just hush.

00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:50.193
What do you mean, "just hush?"

00:09:50.894 --> 00:09:54.064
I laid all this groundwork for you,

00:09:54.464 --> 00:09:56.466
so you should be the one to fire him.

00:09:56.466 --> 00:09:58.568
Why are you just letting
those people run loose?

00:10:01.705 --> 00:10:03.674
Why are you so dumb?

00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:05.309
What?

00:10:05.309 --> 00:10:07.711
We should keep them close
to keep them on a leash.

00:10:08.345 --> 00:10:10.414
If we don't, they'll kick up
even more trouble than now.

00:10:11.248 --> 00:10:12.849
Does that really not occur to you?

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.021
Even sending Won Bin to Daegu like that...

00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:19.256
was already a risky move for us.

00:10:19.923 --> 00:10:21.625
If we cut Cho Na Jeong too
in a situation like this,

00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:23.393
who's going to believe
that's just a coincidence?

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.062
Then, what's your plan?

00:10:25.062 --> 00:10:27.331
Are you just going to sit back
and watch Cho Na Jeong?

00:10:48.218 --> 00:10:49.386
Look at that baby.

00:10:50.554 --> 00:10:51.822
She's so adorable.

00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:54.057
If you have such a cute baby,

00:10:54.057 --> 00:10:55.792
you'd be full without eating.

00:11:16.747 --> 00:11:17.614
Ms. Cho.

00:11:18.215 --> 00:11:19.149
Yeah?

00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:20.984
What are you so deep in thought about?

00:11:20.984 --> 00:11:24.354
I was wondering if there's a fun angle
for the next segment.

00:11:25.322 --> 00:11:26.556
How's married life?

00:11:26.556 --> 00:11:27.457
Are you happy?

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:31.161
Why didn't I do
something this great sooner?

00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:32.663
That's what I keep thinking.

00:11:33.196 --> 00:11:34.231
That's good to hear.

00:11:34.998 --> 00:11:36.867
Actually, for the next episode,

00:11:36.867 --> 00:11:39.436
I was thinking of doing something fun
about marriage.

00:11:39.436 --> 00:11:40.570
Like what?

00:11:41.905 --> 00:11:46.343
I heard about this couple
who are about to get married.

00:11:46.343 --> 00:11:47.945
The guy has azoospermia,

00:11:47.945 --> 00:11:50.581
or the woman went into early menopause,
or something like that.

00:11:51.348 --> 00:11:55.118
And they were debating
whether to tell each other or not.

00:11:55.986 --> 00:11:57.688
You're married, so you'd have an idea.

00:11:57.688 --> 00:12:00.324
What do you think they should do?

00:12:01.425 --> 00:12:03.760
If they get married
without saying anything,

00:12:04.528 --> 00:12:05.228
that's practically a crime.

00:12:08.398 --> 00:12:10.467
- Really?
- Of course, it is.

00:12:11.768 --> 00:12:14.037
I've heard a story like that
somewhere before too.

00:12:14.037 --> 00:12:15.973
The guy had azoospermia,

00:12:15.973 --> 00:12:17.541
but he didn't tell her
and just went ahead and married her.

00:12:18.141 --> 00:12:20.043
The woman found out later,

00:12:20.677 --> 00:12:23.247
and beyond the issue of kids or no kids,

00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:25.215
she felt utterly betrayed.

00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:27.884
I think they ended up getting divorced.

00:12:28.318 --> 00:12:30.487
Are you thinking of talking about that
on "Blunt Sister's Sensible Advice?"

00:12:30.487 --> 00:12:31.455
I'm still...

00:12:32.155 --> 00:12:33.423
on the fence about it.

00:12:33.423 --> 00:12:35.158
I haven't decided yet.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.495
(Deputy Editor's Office)

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:53.210
Sang Gyu,
are you free this weekend evening?

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.311
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

00:12:57.481 --> 00:12:59.650
I was just thinking we should meet too.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.817
I've got something to tell you as well.

00:13:04.021 --> 00:13:05.088
What is it?

00:13:06.156 --> 00:13:07.824
It'd be no fun
if I told you ahead of time.

00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:09.259
I'll tell you when we meet.

00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:12.996
Then see you this weekend.

00:13:13.297 --> 00:13:16.133
I have a shoot during the day,
so how about around 7 p.m.?

00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:17.801
Got it.

00:13:23.273 --> 00:13:25.609
(05:00-06:00 Cho Na Jeong)

00:13:25.609 --> 00:13:27.744
(06:00-07:00 Cho Na Jeong)

00:13:27.744 --> 00:13:28.679
What is this?

00:13:29.413 --> 00:13:32.649
I'm supposed to handle the late-night
and dawn show back-to-back?

00:13:34.217 --> 00:13:36.553
I did say it was way too much.

00:13:37.588 --> 00:13:40.123
"Why waste such a capable intern?"

00:13:40.757 --> 00:13:42.426
This is what she said.

00:13:44.895 --> 00:13:46.229
Now I get...

00:13:46.697 --> 00:13:48.432
why she didn't just fire me.

00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:51.935
She's going to run me
around the clock like this,

00:13:51.935 --> 00:13:53.470
so if I can't take it,
I'm supposed to quit on my own.

00:13:53.937 --> 00:13:55.038
That's the idea, isn't it?

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.342
As if this would make me leave.

00:14:00.177 --> 00:14:02.846
But, Ms. Cho,
if that's what you're going to do,

00:14:02.846 --> 00:14:05.215
you actually need to head
into a meeting right now.

00:14:05.983 --> 00:14:06.850
Really?

00:14:07.718 --> 00:14:08.685
Let's go, then.

00:14:09.152 --> 00:14:11.755
This is actually lower in calories
than you'd think.

00:14:11.755 --> 00:14:15.192
I think it's going to be really popular
with women who are watching their weight.

00:14:15.192 --> 00:14:16.927
I'll try highlighting that.

00:14:26.403 --> 00:14:27.437
(JAKOMO Product Sheet)

00:14:32.576 --> 00:14:35.178
What's the biggest thing
you worry about when choosing a sofa?

00:14:35.178 --> 00:14:36.680
Stains, of course.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.748
Exactly.

00:14:37.748 --> 00:14:39.683
So we prepared this.

00:14:42.819 --> 00:14:44.288
Even if you spill a drink like this,

00:14:47.524 --> 00:14:49.760
one wipe, and you're done.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.130
This is possible because the fabric
is on a whole different level.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.400
It really doesn't soak in at all,
but just rolls right off.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.601
Yes.

00:15:00.103 --> 00:15:01.271
Na Jeong, your meeting.

00:15:02.272 --> 00:15:03.373
Darn it.

00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:23.493
Cho Na Jeong.

00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:25.562
Is this how you plan to do your job?

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.868
What's the issue?

00:15:32.502 --> 00:15:34.071
Did I do something wrong?

00:15:34.438 --> 00:15:36.106
"Did I do something wrong?"

00:15:37.207 --> 00:15:39.243
You don't even realize
what you've done wrong?

00:15:40.277 --> 00:15:41.578
You're a show host,

00:15:41.578 --> 00:15:43.880
and your face on camera looks this dull.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.215
Then who's going to want to buy anything?

00:15:47.718 --> 00:15:48.952
Executive Director,

00:15:48.952 --> 00:15:51.221
since all of Ms. Cho's shows...

00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:53.724
are lined up one after another
late at night and early in the morning,

00:15:53.724 --> 00:15:55.659
of course, it's going to take a toll.

00:15:55.659 --> 00:15:56.460
So what?

00:15:58.028 --> 00:16:00.330
She's going to blame scheduling
for not taking care of herself?

00:16:01.898 --> 00:16:03.300
If you have kids, you blame the kids.

00:16:03.967 --> 00:16:05.769
If you don't manage yourself,
you blame the schedule.

00:16:05.769 --> 00:16:07.237
What are you going to blame next?

00:16:08.505 --> 00:16:09.640
If sales are bad,
you'll blame the product.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.174
If the weather's nice,
you'll blame the weather.

00:16:11.174 --> 00:16:13.777
Why don't you just say it's because
there are no good dramas these days?

00:16:19.816 --> 00:16:20.918
Please.

00:16:21.618 --> 00:16:22.953
If you can't handle it,

00:16:22.953 --> 00:16:24.454
stop being stubborn and leave.

00:16:25.422 --> 00:16:27.224
If you can't even manage your looks
or your stamina,

00:16:27.224 --> 00:16:28.592
why did you crawl back in here?

00:16:29.927 --> 00:16:31.428
Don't you still see...

00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:33.797
that all you're doing
is dragging everyone down?

00:16:40.837 --> 00:16:43.240
Ms. Cho, just a second.

00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:01.858
(Father)

00:17:05.095 --> 00:17:06.630
Yes, Father.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.098
You must be worn out.

00:17:08.098 --> 00:17:10.267
I'm almost finished.
I'm about to head over now.

00:17:10.267 --> 00:17:12.436
Na Jeong, it's not that.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:15.706
I just got a call saying my cousin
who lives in Gunsan...

00:17:15.706 --> 00:17:17.174
passed away,

00:17:17.174 --> 00:17:19.042
so I think I need to go to the funeral.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.246
I see. That must've been a shock.

00:17:22.246 --> 00:17:24.114
Then I'll go home right away.

00:17:24.114 --> 00:17:26.116
No, I'll go now, Father.

00:17:26.116 --> 00:17:26.917
Yes.

00:17:33.457 --> 00:17:35.926
Mr. Kang is at the screen golf range
right now.

00:17:35.926 --> 00:17:36.827
Are you coming?

00:17:45.636 --> 00:17:46.536
Hey.

00:17:49.773 --> 00:17:51.241
What smells so good?

00:17:53.143 --> 00:17:54.578
That looks amazing.

00:17:54.578 --> 00:17:57.014
Hey, it tastes even better than it looks.

00:17:57.514 --> 00:17:58.815
Try it. Wait.

00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:00.717
Here.

00:18:06.123 --> 00:18:07.557
How is it?

00:18:08.659 --> 00:18:09.593
It's insane.

00:18:09.593 --> 00:18:10.894
Seriously amazing.

00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:25.475
So,

00:18:26.577 --> 00:18:27.811
what did you want to talk about?

00:18:28.145 --> 00:18:29.079
Right.

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:31.348
Never mind, you go first.

00:18:31.348 --> 00:18:32.349
Didn't you say you had something to say?

00:18:33.216 --> 00:18:35.152
You go first. What is it?

00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:39.222
All right, then.

00:18:41.725 --> 00:18:43.093
At first,

00:18:43.594 --> 00:18:47.497
I was thinking of doing
some kind of cool event,

00:18:48.165 --> 00:18:50.000
but I figured just being myself
would be best.

00:18:55.138 --> 00:18:55.939
Il Ri.

00:18:57.407 --> 00:18:59.209
Do you really not want to marry me?

00:19:02.879 --> 00:19:06.016
I'm not joking.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.219
I really love these moments
when I cook and we eat together,

00:19:09.219 --> 00:19:10.721
watch TV together,

00:19:11.121 --> 00:19:14.224
and take naps together.
I love those times so much.

00:19:14.224 --> 00:19:17.728
So I want to keep doing
everything with you like this.

00:19:18.662 --> 00:19:21.431
Make you dinner for the rest of my life,

00:19:22.032 --> 00:19:24.968
and let you rest your head on my lap
and relax.

00:19:26.303 --> 00:19:27.471
What about you?

00:19:28.538 --> 00:19:29.573
You don't want that?

00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:33.443
Why not?

00:19:34.344 --> 00:19:36.546
Are you still not sure about me?

00:19:38.348 --> 00:19:39.182
Sang Gyu.

00:19:40.684 --> 00:19:41.551
The truth is...

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.855
The truth is, I...

00:19:51.662 --> 00:19:54.531
(Naraeng)

00:19:55.365 --> 00:19:56.466
Naraeng.

00:19:58.535 --> 00:19:59.436
What's going on?

00:20:00.237 --> 00:20:03.640
- Auntie!
- You little rascals!

00:20:05.142 --> 00:20:07.311
You're late, aren't you?
You should get going, sir.

00:20:07.311 --> 00:20:08.579
Okay.

00:20:08.579 --> 00:20:10.514
Sorry about this at this time.

00:20:10.514 --> 00:20:12.816
Not at all, sir.
Don't worry. You can go.

00:20:13.216 --> 00:20:15.652
All right, then.
I'll leave them in your care.

00:20:18.589 --> 00:20:20.524
Listen to them and have fun, okay?

00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:22.626
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.528
Don't worry.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.066
But who's this guy?

00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:30.667
Me?

00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:32.536
I'm the Santa your mom sent.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.607
But it's not even Christmas.
Why are you Santa?

00:20:37.574 --> 00:20:38.742
Because...

00:20:38.742 --> 00:20:40.944
I brought presents for you two,
Min Woo and Min Jun.

00:20:42.946 --> 00:20:43.847
Yes!

00:20:45.215 --> 00:20:46.416
Where'd you get them?

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.486
I ordered the wrong burger last time,
and they came with it.

00:20:49.486 --> 00:20:50.687
They came to mind.

00:20:56.893 --> 00:20:59.496
I smell a human.

00:21:00.464 --> 00:21:02.366
That's definitely a person.

00:21:03.267 --> 00:21:04.134
Definitely.

00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:05.869
Where could they be?

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.439
There should be two tiny little boys here.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.809
I'm going to eat them up.
Where are they?

00:21:16.246 --> 00:21:17.047
Not here.

00:21:18.015 --> 00:21:19.016
Here they are!

00:21:20.183 --> 00:21:21.952
Here they are!

00:21:33.597 --> 00:21:34.965
I guess I'll just have to eat them up.

00:21:45.242 --> 00:21:46.109
Hello.

00:21:46.109 --> 00:21:47.311
Which room is he in?

00:21:47.811 --> 00:21:49.613
Go straight. It's Room 3.

00:21:49.613 --> 00:21:51.248
Room 3? Do I turn?

00:21:51.248 --> 00:21:52.449
Go straight, and then turn.

00:21:52.449 --> 00:21:53.650
Thanks.

00:22:18.809 --> 00:22:19.710
(Voice Recording)

00:22:31.355 --> 00:22:32.356
Hey, Cho Na Jeong.

00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:37.527
Hello, Mr. Kim.

00:22:37.761 --> 00:22:38.729
What are you doing here?

00:22:39.196 --> 00:22:40.964
Well...

00:22:45.736 --> 00:22:46.503
What?

00:22:47.371 --> 00:22:48.171
You.

00:22:55.045 --> 00:22:57.614
Mr. Kang, you lied, didn't you?

00:22:57.614 --> 00:23:00.117
You all teamed up
and set a trap, didn't you?

00:23:00.117 --> 00:23:01.084
How could you?

00:23:01.084 --> 00:23:03.787
How could you pin false accusations
on someone like that?

00:23:03.787 --> 00:23:04.888
Hey.

00:23:09.259 --> 00:23:10.093
Cho Na Jeong.

00:23:10.093 --> 00:23:12.195
Just the fact that I didn't
call the police on you today...

00:23:12.195 --> 00:23:13.563
means you should count yourself lucky.

00:23:13.563 --> 00:23:14.665
Damn it.

00:23:46.663 --> 00:23:48.298
You're really good with kids.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.968
Have you always liked kids?

00:23:52.235 --> 00:23:54.972
Ever since I was little,
I've really loved kids.

00:23:54.972 --> 00:23:56.540
So I used to look after all the kids
in the neighborhood.

00:23:59.977 --> 00:24:01.411
Then when you get married,

00:24:02.646 --> 00:24:04.047
do you want to have kids?

00:24:05.616 --> 00:24:06.984
Of course.

00:24:06.984 --> 00:24:09.319
I'd love to have a daughter
who looks just like you.

00:24:11.622 --> 00:24:12.623
Actually,

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:14.725
I'm an only child.

00:24:14.725 --> 00:24:16.460
So I was really lonely growing up.

00:24:17.728 --> 00:24:19.830
So whenever I saw big, noisy families,

00:24:20.297 --> 00:24:22.499
I used to think
that when I grew up and got married,

00:24:23.066 --> 00:24:25.869
I'd have two or three kids
and live happily.

00:24:28.672 --> 00:24:31.008
But we're not exactly young anymore,

00:24:32.042 --> 00:24:35.045
so if we're going to worry about
whether to have kids or not,

00:24:35.846 --> 00:24:39.716
shouldn't we at least get married first?

00:24:46.857 --> 00:24:47.758
Is that Na Jeong?

00:24:50.494 --> 00:24:51.461
Il Ri.

00:24:54.431 --> 00:24:55.866
- Sang Gyu.
- You're here.

00:24:56.133 --> 00:24:57.935
Sorry I'm late. What about the kids?

00:24:57.935 --> 00:24:59.169
They're asleep.

00:24:59.169 --> 00:25:01.371
You didn't have to rush over.

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:04.741
What happened to your hand?

00:25:05.342 --> 00:25:06.376
It's nothing.

00:25:10.714 --> 00:25:12.816
This is unbelievable.

00:25:13.517 --> 00:25:15.819
How can people be that shameless?

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.022
So your husband is being worked
around the clock...

00:25:19.022 --> 00:25:20.691
at the Daegu logistics center right now?

00:25:21.825 --> 00:25:22.626
Yes.

00:25:24.361 --> 00:25:26.196
Sorry to drag you out on a weekend night.

00:25:26.196 --> 00:25:28.265
No, we weren't tired at all.

00:25:28.732 --> 00:25:30.367
Sang Gyu watched the kids,

00:25:30.367 --> 00:25:31.902
and I just sat there the whole time.

00:25:31.902 --> 00:25:34.037
I really wasn't tired at all.

00:25:34.037 --> 00:25:36.139
I've always really liked kids.

00:25:36.607 --> 00:25:38.008
Thank you so much.

00:25:42.546 --> 00:25:45.048
But...

00:25:45.983 --> 00:25:47.384
are we really doing the right thing?

00:25:48.452 --> 00:25:49.920
I think we were too reckless.

00:25:51.288 --> 00:25:53.557
At first, I thought it would be okay.

00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:58.629
I thought we'd be able to get through it,

00:25:59.129 --> 00:26:00.764
but no matter what we do,
I can't see a way out.

00:26:02.232 --> 00:26:04.635
And at work, they're pressuring us
like they're trying to crush us.

00:26:06.136 --> 00:26:07.237
Sometimes I wonder...

00:26:08.372 --> 00:26:10.073
if I should've just told
my husband to quit.

00:26:12.609 --> 00:26:16.346
If both he and I end up getting fired,

00:26:17.281 --> 00:26:18.548
then what are the kids and I...

00:26:19.483 --> 00:26:20.684
supposed to do?

00:26:26.323 --> 00:26:27.958
Na Jeong, have you heard this saying...

00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:30.427
that goodness is a struggle?

00:26:32.362 --> 00:26:33.864
In this filthy world,

00:26:33.864 --> 00:26:36.366
bad people actually have it much easier.

00:26:37.567 --> 00:26:39.836
But people who try to live kindly...

00:26:39.836 --> 00:26:42.873
have been fighting all along
just to stay good.

00:26:42.873 --> 00:26:44.441
It's not like their lives
just turn out that way.

00:26:45.309 --> 00:26:47.878
I think that takes a lot of courage
and is really admirable.

00:26:48.745 --> 00:26:51.748
In that sense, I honestly think
you and your husband are amazing.

00:26:53.817 --> 00:26:55.185
And you said this before, didn't you?

00:26:55.919 --> 00:26:58.655
That you might fool your own conscience,
but you could never fool your children.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.491
That the scariest thought was...

00:27:01.491 --> 00:27:02.726
your kids growing up to be like you.

00:27:03.894 --> 00:27:05.729
That's what being a parent is, right?

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.333
It's not easy in this world to be a parent
your children won't be ashamed of.

00:27:11.234 --> 00:27:12.269
Thank you, Sang Gyu.

00:27:15.739 --> 00:27:18.609
But where could we find proof...

00:27:18.609 --> 00:27:20.410
that those people schemed together?

00:27:20.978 --> 00:27:22.946
There are no witnesses and no recordings.

00:27:22.946 --> 00:27:24.281
There's no way to prove it.

00:27:25.048 --> 00:27:27.217
Should we plant a recorder...

00:27:27.217 --> 00:27:29.253
in the bar they always go to or something?

00:27:30.387 --> 00:27:32.289
Just the fact that I didn't
call the police on you today...

00:27:32.289 --> 00:27:33.557
means you should count yourself lucky.

00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:35.092
Damn it.

00:27:44.668 --> 00:27:47.871
Come to think of it,
I saw Mr. Kang and Mr. Kim...

00:27:48.372 --> 00:27:49.873
riding in the same car.

00:27:51.208 --> 00:27:52.376
They weren't in separate cars.

00:27:52.943 --> 00:27:54.945
Then that means they carpool together.

00:27:55.379 --> 00:27:58.248
So their conversations...

00:27:58.248 --> 00:28:00.017
might be recorded on the dashcam.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.919
Yeah, that's very possible.

00:28:02.352 --> 00:28:04.021
But how would we ever get...

00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:05.689
the dashcam from someone else's car?

00:28:05.689 --> 00:28:06.690
No.

00:28:07.457 --> 00:28:09.092
I feel like there might be some way.

00:28:12.562 --> 00:28:14.498
Really? And?

00:28:15.198 --> 00:28:18.001
They're known
for always going golfing together.

00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:19.469
Mr. Kang always picks him up,

00:28:19.469 --> 00:28:21.972
they play golf,
and then drink together afterward.

00:28:22.639 --> 00:28:23.574
I see.

00:28:23.574 --> 00:28:26.743
So Mr. Kang always picks up Mr. Kim.

00:28:26.743 --> 00:28:28.045
That's right.

00:28:28.045 --> 00:28:29.613
Then there's a good chance...

00:28:29.613 --> 00:28:31.548
something's on the dashcam, right?

00:28:31.782 --> 00:28:34.851
Honey, I get what you're saying,

00:28:34.851 --> 00:28:36.520
but you're not seriously thinking
of going to his car...

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.822
and pulling out the memory card, are you?

00:28:39.756 --> 00:28:41.124
That would be a crime.

00:28:41.124 --> 00:28:42.292
So don't get involved.
Just stay put and I'll go...

00:28:42.292 --> 00:28:43.393
Forget it.

00:28:43.594 --> 00:28:45.095
Is this really the time for us
to worry about right and wrong?

00:28:45.295 --> 00:28:47.464
And compared to what those guys did,

00:28:47.464 --> 00:28:48.932
this is nothing.

00:28:48.932 --> 00:28:49.933
Hang up for now.

00:28:49.933 --> 00:28:51.602
I have to take the kids to kindergarten
and then head out.

00:28:51.602 --> 00:28:52.836
Honey.

00:28:55.572 --> 00:28:56.540
Goodness.

00:28:57.074 --> 00:28:58.075
All right.

00:28:58.075 --> 00:29:00.210
Our little princes,
let's put on your socks now.

00:29:02.813 --> 00:29:06.216
When did you two learn
to put on socks on your own?

00:29:06.216 --> 00:29:07.451
Mom.

00:29:07.751 --> 00:29:09.886
We're big boys now.
We can put on our own socks.

00:29:09.886 --> 00:29:12.322
Look at me too.
I put mine on by myself.

00:29:18.428 --> 00:29:20.964
When did you two grow this much?

00:29:21.832 --> 00:29:23.033
I'm so proud.

00:29:26.303 --> 00:29:28.038
- Min Jun.
- Yeah?

00:29:28.038 --> 00:29:29.273
You're upset that Mom and Dad...

00:29:30.173 --> 00:29:33.043
can't play with you
as much as before, right?

00:29:34.578 --> 00:29:37.581
But if our family is going to be happy,

00:29:37.581 --> 00:29:38.782
there's no other way.

00:29:38.782 --> 00:29:41.985
So even if it's hard,
hang in there just a little longer, okay?

00:29:41.985 --> 00:29:42.653
Okay.

00:29:44.454 --> 00:29:47.057
No. I like it better
that you go to work, Mom.

00:29:48.458 --> 00:29:49.326
Why?

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:51.094
Because you smile more.

00:29:51.662 --> 00:29:55.499
When you stayed home all the time,
you looked sad.

00:29:55.499 --> 00:29:58.101
But when you go to work, you look happy.
So I like it.

00:30:03.373 --> 00:30:05.442
Hug me too.

00:30:06.643 --> 00:30:07.544
My babies.

00:30:42.312 --> 00:30:43.247
(Mother)

00:30:57.027 --> 00:30:58.095
What's going on?

00:30:58.562 --> 00:31:00.230
Have you been well, Mother?

00:31:00.797 --> 00:31:02.833
Do you think you could be well
if you were in my shoes?

00:31:04.167 --> 00:31:06.436
I'm sorry about what happened last time.

00:31:08.038 --> 00:31:10.073
My mother is very sensitive to begin with,

00:31:10.874 --> 00:31:12.743
and she got defensive because of me.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.879
So she ended up being rude to you.

00:31:17.314 --> 00:31:19.049
I'd like to apologize on her behalf.

00:31:19.449 --> 00:31:20.217
No.

00:31:20.884 --> 00:31:22.219
I wasn't in the right either.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.455
I got worked up
and said things I shouldn't have.

00:31:25.455 --> 00:31:27.057
That's on me.

00:31:28.091 --> 00:31:29.793
Please also tell your mother
that I'm sorry about...

00:31:32.496 --> 00:31:33.363
Never mind.

00:31:34.464 --> 00:31:37.935
Now that everything's over,
what good would that do?

00:31:38.835 --> 00:31:39.870
But, Mother,

00:31:41.204 --> 00:31:42.339
that's not why I called.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:47.978
At first,

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:51.915
when I saw that doll, I was so shocked.

00:31:52.883 --> 00:31:54.851
So instead of looking into it,

00:31:56.353 --> 00:31:58.088
I just got angry at Sang Min...

00:31:59.122 --> 00:32:01.058
and jumped to conclusions.

00:32:04.561 --> 00:32:06.463
So I asked him about it,

00:32:07.698 --> 00:32:09.433
but he wouldn't tell me anything at all.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.501
I was frustrated,

00:32:12.603 --> 00:32:15.072
so I came here to ask you directly.

00:32:16.406 --> 00:32:17.674
You know...

00:32:19.209 --> 00:32:20.544
what that doll means, don't you, Mother?

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.072
(Sujeong Boutique)

00:33:24.741 --> 00:33:25.609
Yes.

00:33:27.244 --> 00:33:28.278
Those...

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.282
aren't the strange things
you're imagining.

00:33:33.016 --> 00:33:35.919
They're mannequins I used
back when I ran a dress shop.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.956
After I closed the shop,
I had nowhere to put them,

00:33:39.189 --> 00:33:40.791
so I left them in the basement.

00:33:41.258 --> 00:33:43.460
It never occurred to me...

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.761
that Sang Min wouldn't tell you.

00:33:47.197 --> 00:33:50.634
The truth is,

00:33:54.171 --> 00:33:55.772
his father was a man
you just couldn't talk to.

00:33:56.873 --> 00:33:58.842
and he had a terrible habit
of hitting people.

00:33:59.309 --> 00:34:01.445
Dad, no.

00:34:01.445 --> 00:34:02.813
Please.

00:34:04.047 --> 00:34:06.250
Yeah, keep crying like that!

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:08.585
What kind of man
cries over every little thing?

00:34:08.885 --> 00:34:10.921
How many times have I told you
to cut that out?

00:34:11.521 --> 00:34:12.723
Honey.

00:34:15.492 --> 00:34:17.294
What is this? Move.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.932
It's because you keep coddling him...

00:34:21.932 --> 00:34:24.001
that the kid ended up like this.

00:34:24.001 --> 00:34:28.772
Just kill me instead.

00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:32.342
Damn it.

00:34:32.809 --> 00:34:35.145
Dad, please don't hurt us.

00:34:36.246 --> 00:34:37.147
Please.

00:34:39.182 --> 00:34:40.317
Hey!

00:34:41.785 --> 00:34:43.620
You still haven't been hit enough yet.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.289
Come here.

00:34:45.289 --> 00:34:46.790
Mom!

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:48.158
- Come here!
- Honey.

00:34:48.158 --> 00:34:50.127
- Mom!
- Honey.

00:34:50.127 --> 00:34:51.228
Mom.

00:34:51.228 --> 00:34:52.262
Honey.

00:34:56.033 --> 00:34:57.200
- Get over here.
- Dad!

00:34:57.601 --> 00:34:58.568
Dad!

00:35:01.305 --> 00:35:02.239
Any time Sang Min cried,

00:35:02.973 --> 00:35:05.309
he'd say a boy shouldn't cry like a girl,

00:35:06.343 --> 00:35:08.111
and he'd beat him over and over.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.214
Mom.

00:35:47.417 --> 00:35:49.386
After agonizing over it for so long,

00:35:50.687 --> 00:35:51.722
I said...

00:35:52.356 --> 00:35:53.290
Sang Min.

00:35:54.424 --> 00:35:55.659
You must have been so scared.

00:35:58.495 --> 00:36:01.932
These dolls aren't scary at all.

00:36:02.532 --> 00:36:04.368
They're guardian angels watching over you.

00:36:08.805 --> 00:36:09.840
Angels?

00:36:14.144 --> 00:36:15.178
Their names are...

00:36:16.146 --> 00:36:19.182
Rebecca and Jessica.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.184
Rebecca.

00:36:21.885 --> 00:36:23.053
Jessica.

00:36:26.857 --> 00:36:27.791
Angels?

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.061
Yeah.

00:36:32.296 --> 00:36:33.764
So he wouldn't get scared,

00:36:34.598 --> 00:36:36.300
I gave the mannequins names.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.802
Rebecca and Jessica.

00:36:39.703 --> 00:36:40.637
And after that,

00:36:41.705 --> 00:36:43.774
even when he was locked in there,

00:36:44.274 --> 00:36:46.143
I didn't hear him crying anymore.

00:36:47.945 --> 00:36:49.112
It's all my fault.

00:36:49.746 --> 00:36:51.548
I should've left his father long ago.

00:36:52.783 --> 00:36:55.185
After my dress shop went under,

00:36:55.185 --> 00:36:56.887
I wasn't sure
I could support us on my own,

00:36:57.788 --> 00:36:59.289
and I thought even a terrible father...

00:37:00.057 --> 00:37:03.493
was better than no father at all.
So I just stayed and endured it.

00:37:04.194 --> 00:37:07.564
I never imagined
that Sang Min would go on...

00:37:08.632 --> 00:37:10.500
clinging to them like that.

00:37:13.704 --> 00:37:18.041
The reason I kept nagging you two
to have kids...

00:37:18.709 --> 00:37:19.910
is because someone once told me...

00:37:21.578 --> 00:37:23.247
that the scars left from not being loved
from your parents...

00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:27.684
naturally heal...

00:37:28.452 --> 00:37:30.087
when you pour love into your own children.

00:37:32.723 --> 00:37:33.590
Joo Young.

00:37:34.458 --> 00:37:35.359
I'm sorry.

00:37:37.728 --> 00:37:39.296
Back then, I was too young,

00:37:40.097 --> 00:37:42.099
and in those days,
divorce was treated like a sin,

00:37:43.567 --> 00:37:46.103
and I barely understood
what it meant to be a mother.

00:37:47.504 --> 00:37:49.773
I was so foolish.

00:38:11.561 --> 00:38:12.462
I think...

00:38:14.531 --> 00:38:17.134
there's some kind of wall
around my heart,

00:38:19.102 --> 00:38:20.504
and I feel guilty toward you too.

00:38:21.204 --> 00:38:22.172
No!

00:38:22.839 --> 00:38:23.707
Let go.

00:38:23.707 --> 00:38:25.842
No, you'll hurt her.

00:38:25.842 --> 00:38:26.643
Let go!

00:38:30.447 --> 00:38:31.515
Rebecca.

00:38:31.882 --> 00:38:34.251
Rebecca!

00:39:56.767 --> 00:39:57.634
Tae Jeong.

00:39:59.736 --> 00:40:00.938
- You go on ahead.
- Okay.

00:40:01.605 --> 00:40:02.439
Okay.

00:40:03.607 --> 00:40:05.709
I have a favor to ask.

00:40:06.843 --> 00:40:07.844
Okay.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.183
(Sweet Home Shopping)

00:40:13.183 --> 00:40:16.853
Does anyone have anything else
to add to today's agenda?

00:40:16.853 --> 00:40:17.654
No.

00:40:18.422 --> 00:40:19.723
Please speak freely if you do.

00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:22.392
- Nothing more from me.
- Same here.

00:40:22.392 --> 00:40:23.226
Okay.

00:40:23.226 --> 00:40:24.928
Then let's wrap up here.

00:40:25.762 --> 00:40:27.764
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:40:27.764 --> 00:40:28.732
Thank you.

00:40:42.913 --> 00:40:43.780
Hey.

00:40:46.016 --> 00:40:48.619
Come pick me up in front of my place
by 11 tomorrow morning.

00:40:51.788 --> 00:40:54.758
And just like last time, hit two OBs
and make a triple bogey.

00:40:55.292 --> 00:40:57.461
Then you're paying the green fee.

00:41:00.564 --> 00:41:02.432
Okay, see you tomorrow.

00:41:05.602 --> 00:41:07.771
They're going golfing together tomorrow.

00:41:07.771 --> 00:41:10.674
There's a bar
they always stop by together after golf.

00:41:14.278 --> 00:41:17.047
It's a private bar called Polyamour.

00:41:17.447 --> 00:41:18.782
(Polyamour)

00:41:18.782 --> 00:41:21.551
If they leave at 11 a.m.,
they usually tee off at 1 p.m.,

00:41:21.551 --> 00:41:23.220
play until around five,

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.788
then wash up and have dinner.

00:41:24.788 --> 00:41:27.691
So they'll probably get here
around seven or eight.

00:41:27.691 --> 00:41:29.426
- Okay, got it.
- Yes.

00:41:29.426 --> 00:41:32.863
Mr. Kang's car is a large gray SUV
from L Motors.

00:42:17.874 --> 00:42:18.809
What was that?

00:42:32.723 --> 00:42:33.724
Four-five-three-four.

00:42:33.724 --> 00:42:35.125
- Four-five-three-four?
- Yes.

00:42:51.308 --> 00:42:52.209
Are you the valet?

00:42:53.343 --> 00:42:56.079
No, I'm waiting too.

00:42:58.382 --> 00:42:59.316
Where did he go?

00:43:05.355 --> 00:43:07.324
- Did you call a substitute driver?
- Yes.

00:43:07.324 --> 00:43:09.026
- What's your plate number?
- 5478.

00:43:09.793 --> 00:43:13.030
Five-four-seven-eight.

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.764
Yes.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:34.484
One-two-six-three.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:50.767
Yes, I'm at 12-5, Seongdam-dong.

00:43:51.969 --> 00:43:54.771
Donhyeon-dong, Jindonga Apartments.

00:43:55.639 --> 00:43:56.573
Thirty dollars?

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.975
Okay.

00:43:57.975 --> 00:43:59.309
Yes. Come quickly.

00:44:05.716 --> 00:44:06.817
Did you call a substitute driver?

00:44:08.085 --> 00:44:08.952
What?

00:44:08.952 --> 00:44:11.788
But I just called.
How did you get here so fast?

00:44:12.155 --> 00:44:13.423
I was right nearby.

00:44:15.025 --> 00:44:15.826
Wait.

00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:29.539
Where's your car?

00:44:45.889 --> 00:44:47.624
Come on.

00:44:50.661 --> 00:44:53.664
Why are you doing this? How many times
do I have to say I don't want it?

00:44:53.664 --> 00:44:55.632
What do you mean, you don't?

00:44:56.366 --> 00:44:58.769
Stop playing hard to get
and just officially date me.

00:44:59.269 --> 00:45:00.837
I said I don't want to.

00:45:08.445 --> 00:45:10.847
Why are you pushing me away...

00:45:11.815 --> 00:45:13.417
after taking all the benefits?

00:45:14.885 --> 00:45:15.719
Get over here.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.321
Hey, Mr. Kang.

00:45:17.921 --> 00:45:20.724
I'm having another drink with Ye Na,
so you go on ahead.

00:45:20.724 --> 00:45:22.526
Okay, have a good time.

00:45:22.526 --> 00:45:24.895
Lucky you. Bye.

00:45:37.908 --> 00:45:38.742
Donhyeon-dong.

00:45:46.617 --> 00:45:47.684
Why aren't we moving?

00:45:51.822 --> 00:45:53.490
Sir, fasten your seat belt tightly.

00:46:07.571 --> 00:46:08.472
Ye Na.

00:46:09.873 --> 00:46:12.309
Let me out. I want to go home.

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:14.444
Ye Na.

00:46:15.345 --> 00:46:18.115
Stop doing this!

00:46:23.387 --> 00:46:24.321
Song Ye Na.

00:46:25.489 --> 00:46:27.824
Did you think
"Song Ye Na's Secret Closet" was free?

00:46:29.259 --> 00:46:32.262
Were you planning to just take primetime
and keep your mouth shut?

00:46:36.233 --> 00:46:38.335
Let's just have a good time, okay?

00:46:41.004 --> 00:46:42.673
Sir, please hurry.

00:46:58.021 --> 00:46:59.756
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

00:46:59.756 --> 00:47:00.824
You should drive properly.

00:47:01.425 --> 00:47:02.459
Be quiet.

00:47:02.459 --> 00:47:03.961
It's hectic enough.
Just keep your mouth shut.

00:47:21.645 --> 00:47:23.647
What do you think you're doing?

00:47:47.237 --> 00:47:48.205
What are you doing?

00:47:48.205 --> 00:47:49.172
I'm sorry, sir.

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:54.011
Ye Na, get out.

00:47:55.545 --> 00:47:56.914
Hey, Cho Na Jeong.

00:48:00.217 --> 00:48:01.084
Cho Na Jeong.

00:48:01.952 --> 00:48:03.186
What are you doing?

00:48:03.186 --> 00:48:04.187
Are you out of your mind?

00:48:04.521 --> 00:48:06.823
I should be asking you, Mr. Kim.

00:48:07.257 --> 00:48:08.358
What are you saying?

00:48:09.192 --> 00:48:11.695
A boss can't have a drink
with his employee?

00:48:12.029 --> 00:48:13.130
We can't even share a taxi?

00:48:17.067 --> 00:48:19.369
Mr. Kang! Damn it.

00:48:20.037 --> 00:48:21.438
- Let's go.
- Hey.

00:48:22.706 --> 00:48:24.374
Song Ye Na, you tell her.

00:48:25.509 --> 00:48:26.843
Did I drag you here against your will?

00:48:27.411 --> 00:48:29.580
Weren't we together
because you said you wanted another drink?

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.714
Come on. Tell her!

00:48:32.849 --> 00:48:33.817
Tell her what?

00:48:34.818 --> 00:48:37.020
You did drag me along
even though I said no.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.189
I said I didn't want to go,
but you forced me into the taxi.

00:48:40.223 --> 00:48:41.825
Why do you keep hitting on me
when I keep telling you no?

00:48:42.326 --> 00:48:44.227
I clearly told you I didn't want this,

00:48:44.227 --> 00:48:46.763
so why do you keep putting your hands
all over me, you disgusting bastard?

00:48:46.763 --> 00:48:47.664
Hey.

00:48:53.003 --> 00:48:53.971
Cho Na Jeong!

00:48:59.476 --> 00:49:00.477
Damn it.

00:49:06.583 --> 00:49:07.417
Here.

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:17.561
Why do you even go
when those jerks call you out for drinks?

00:49:17.561 --> 00:49:18.929
If it feels dangerous,

00:49:18.929 --> 00:49:21.231
you shouldn't go in the first place.

00:49:21.965 --> 00:49:24.701
He kept saying
he gave me a primetime segment,

00:49:24.701 --> 00:49:26.036
but I never came to thank him,

00:49:27.337 --> 00:49:29.573
and kept calling me ungrateful.

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.442
I was really stuck in the middle too.

00:49:35.078 --> 00:49:37.881
Now you get exactly what I meant, right?

00:49:37.881 --> 00:49:41.184
Do you really have to get burned to learn?

00:49:44.021 --> 00:49:44.855
But...

00:49:45.889 --> 00:49:47.991
why were you there, Na Jeong?

00:49:48.825 --> 00:49:50.861
I went to find proof...

00:49:50.861 --> 00:49:52.229
that those bastards framed my husband.

00:49:55.032 --> 00:49:58.201
But Kim Jeong Sik saw your face.

00:49:58.201 --> 00:49:59.102
What are you going to do now?

00:50:00.804 --> 00:50:02.039
Well, there's nothing I can do now.

00:50:02.639 --> 00:50:04.641
I couldn't just watch you
get dragged off like that...

00:50:04.641 --> 00:50:05.842
and go home, could I?

00:50:08.545 --> 00:50:10.881
I've already got
more than enough on my plate,

00:50:10.881 --> 00:50:13.617
but thanks to my nosiness,
I blew my chance at evidence.

00:50:18.422 --> 00:50:19.656
Who can I blame but myself?

00:50:21.992 --> 00:50:23.093
You're sober now, right?

00:50:23.093 --> 00:50:25.128
I'm going home. Get home safe.

00:50:25.128 --> 00:50:25.929
Na Jeong.

00:50:26.129 --> 00:50:28.532
Can I sleep at your place
just for tonight?

00:50:29.166 --> 00:50:29.933
What?

00:50:29.933 --> 00:50:31.902
Since I live alone,

00:50:31.902 --> 00:50:33.770
I'm scared Kim Jeong Sik
might come looking for me.

00:50:34.304 --> 00:50:36.306
I really don't think I could handle that.

00:50:37.407 --> 00:50:39.876
But sleeping at the office
feels even scarier.

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.288
You can sit.

00:50:52.256 --> 00:50:53.991
My place is small,
so I don't have a spare room.

00:50:53.991 --> 00:50:55.492
You can sleep in the bed.

00:50:55.492 --> 00:50:57.594
I have to keep getting up
because of the kids anyway.

00:51:00.731 --> 00:51:01.598
Thank you.

00:51:05.235 --> 00:51:08.238
I'm dying.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.277
I thrashed around
like I was shooting an action movie,

00:51:13.977 --> 00:51:15.979
and now my whole body aches.

00:51:24.588 --> 00:51:25.422
But...

00:51:26.156 --> 00:51:29.526
for now, don't think about anything
and just sleep.

00:51:30.627 --> 00:51:32.162
Once you've slept a bit,

00:51:32.896 --> 00:51:34.965
your tangled-up thoughts
will start to settle.

00:51:37.401 --> 00:51:38.368
I'm turning off the light.

00:51:45.208 --> 00:51:46.076
Good night.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.368
What do you mean?

00:52:11.635 --> 00:52:12.736
What did you say Cho Na Jeong saw?

00:52:14.972 --> 00:52:16.173
Get out.

00:52:21.445 --> 00:52:22.946
What happened was this.

00:52:23.814 --> 00:52:27.684
Kang Jong Ryeol, Song Ye Na,
and I had a drink together.

00:52:28.118 --> 00:52:30.887
Then Ye Na and I got into a taxi,

00:52:31.421 --> 00:52:34.291
when out of nowhere,
Cho Na Jeong showed up...

00:52:35.025 --> 00:52:36.460
and pulled Ye Na away.

00:52:37.394 --> 00:52:38.795
Why did you call Song Ye Na out
in the first place?

00:52:40.297 --> 00:52:42.065
Why Song Ye Na?

00:52:44.468 --> 00:52:47.504
It's not like I had
some big ulterior motive.

00:52:47.504 --> 00:52:49.373
Since we're in the same boat now,

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.542
I just wanted to make a friendly gesture.

00:52:55.879 --> 00:52:57.114
Are you even human?

00:52:58.081 --> 00:52:59.316
Are you even human?

00:52:59.816 --> 00:53:01.852
Do you have any idea what it took for me
to cover for you,

00:53:01.852 --> 00:53:04.288
how I felt shielding you like that?

00:53:04.721 --> 00:53:06.823
What are you going to do now?

00:53:06.823 --> 00:53:08.425
What are you going to do?

00:53:08.425 --> 00:53:10.928
You crazy bastard!

00:53:11.561 --> 00:53:12.496
Gyeong Seon.

00:53:14.398 --> 00:53:16.166
What is wrong with me?

00:53:17.668 --> 00:53:18.568
I'm sorry.

00:53:21.038 --> 00:53:23.373
I was just lonely.

00:53:24.007 --> 00:53:26.143
You hated me so much
and looked down on me,

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:28.612
so I was hurt too, that's all.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.487
Gyeong Seon.

00:53:38.355 --> 00:53:40.257
Please, just spare me this once.

00:53:40.257 --> 00:53:42.793
I swear I'll never slip up again.

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.628
Just this once, please save me.

00:53:45.696 --> 00:53:46.830
Please.

00:53:47.631 --> 00:53:49.466
What is wrong with me?

00:53:49.466 --> 00:53:51.435
Good grief.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.857
Where did she go?

00:54:22.566 --> 00:54:26.203
These days, there are so many types
of food waste disposers, right?

00:54:26.203 --> 00:54:27.304
What makes this different?

00:54:27.304 --> 00:54:29.940
That's right.
The basics are a given, of course,

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:32.309
but Airben goes beyond that.

00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:35.178
In the past,
no matter how often we changed the filter,

00:54:35.178 --> 00:54:37.247
there were still times
when the smell lingered.

00:54:37.247 --> 00:54:38.916
And that was because of the internal pipe.

00:54:38.916 --> 00:54:40.984
If the internal pipe doesn't dry properly,

00:54:40.984 --> 00:54:42.786
the odor can stick around.

00:54:42.786 --> 00:54:45.989
But Airben is a product
that solves that problem.

00:54:45.989 --> 00:54:46.823
Food waste...

00:54:52.162 --> 00:54:54.665
You can't sleep?

00:54:57.301 --> 00:54:58.468
Do you want some honey water?

00:54:59.803 --> 00:55:02.306
No, I'm okay.

00:55:04.174 --> 00:55:05.108
Na Jeong.

00:55:08.412 --> 00:55:09.646
I'm really sorry.

00:55:11.615 --> 00:55:12.516
I...

00:55:14.017 --> 00:55:15.485
wanted to succeed so badly.

00:55:17.955 --> 00:55:19.957
So even though I knew I shouldn't,

00:55:21.892 --> 00:55:24.928
I kept quiet when that bastard
Kim Jeong Sik came on to me,

00:55:27.798 --> 00:55:29.933
and I kept quiet
when Executive Director Seo told me...

00:55:29.933 --> 00:55:31.101
to keep quiet.

00:55:32.769 --> 00:55:34.438
When Seon Min ended up like that,

00:55:36.974 --> 00:55:38.242
it tore me apart,

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:42.512
but I thought,
"If I just suck it up, it'll blow over."

00:55:43.647 --> 00:55:45.816
"Then it'll become nothing."

00:55:46.717 --> 00:55:49.019
"Just let it pass."

00:55:50.954 --> 00:55:53.223
So I shut my eyes and ears like that,

00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:00.464
and now those bastards
are using that against me...

00:56:00.464 --> 00:56:02.266
to make me lie too.

00:56:05.035 --> 00:56:07.838
Like you said,
I knew it was a poisoned cup,

00:56:12.175 --> 00:56:13.410
but it was too sweet.

00:56:15.212 --> 00:56:17.514
When in my life would I ever
get to do a primetime segment again?

00:56:19.082 --> 00:56:20.384
If I miss this chance,

00:56:21.685 --> 00:56:23.086
I'll never get another.

00:56:24.021 --> 00:56:25.389
Thinking that,

00:56:27.024 --> 00:56:28.926
the lies came out of my mouth
without shame.

00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:34.231
Na Jeong.

00:56:36.266 --> 00:56:37.801
If I tell the truth,

00:56:40.037 --> 00:56:41.705
I'll be blacklisted
from the whole industry, right?

00:56:44.875 --> 00:56:46.944
But if I don't,

00:56:48.545 --> 00:56:51.081
I'll just keep being used like this
by Kim Jeong Sik, won't I?

00:56:54.618 --> 00:56:56.019
It's all my fault.

00:56:57.287 --> 00:56:59.156
If I hadn't turned a blind eye,

00:57:01.758 --> 00:57:04.428
if I hadn't tried hard
to stay on Kim Jeong Sik's good side...

00:57:09.466 --> 00:57:11.435
(Executive Director Seo Gyeong Seon)

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.088
Executive Director.

00:57:31.989 --> 00:57:33.724
Na Jeong.

00:57:35.592 --> 00:57:38.295
Is Ye Na at your place, by any chance?

00:57:39.263 --> 00:57:40.130
Yes.

00:57:40.764 --> 00:57:41.665
I see.

00:57:42.699 --> 00:57:45.002
I think Ye Na
might be misunderstanding something,

00:57:45.636 --> 00:57:48.005
so I called, but she didn't pick up,
and she wasn't home.

00:57:48.472 --> 00:57:50.173
And I had a feeling she'd be with you.

00:57:51.942 --> 00:57:53.043
I'm sorry,

00:57:53.443 --> 00:57:55.879
but could you ask Ye Na to step out
for a moment?

00:57:56.546 --> 00:57:57.447
No.

00:57:57.714 --> 00:57:59.983
I think it'd be better
if she didn't see anyone right now.

00:58:01.885 --> 00:58:03.954
All right, I understand.

00:58:05.322 --> 00:58:08.392
But I hope you won't misunderstand either.

00:58:09.126 --> 00:58:11.161
Kim Jeong Sik is very sociable...

00:58:11.161 --> 00:58:12.896
and has a rather naive side,

00:58:12.896 --> 00:58:14.264
so people do get the wrong idea about him.

00:58:14.898 --> 00:58:16.300
This time, he really says...

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.368
he only called Ye Na out for a drink.

00:58:23.607 --> 00:58:25.742
What I really want to tell you is this.

00:58:27.911 --> 00:58:30.881
If you just turn a blind eye to this,

00:58:31.715 --> 00:58:33.283
the contract you've wanted so badly.

00:58:33.283 --> 00:58:35.018
I can sign it for you
as early as tomorrow,

00:58:35.018 --> 00:58:36.753
and we'll reinstate Won Bin
right away too.

00:58:37.487 --> 00:58:40.724
You've been dying to come back here,
haven't you?

00:58:40.724 --> 00:58:42.292
If you pretend you don't know
just this once,

00:58:42.793 --> 00:58:45.062
you can keep working as the show host...

00:58:45.062 --> 00:58:46.129
you've always dreamed of being.

00:58:46.663 --> 00:58:48.131
And you're good at what you do.

00:58:48.732 --> 00:58:51.001
You could even launch
your own brand someday.

00:58:51.501 --> 00:58:53.370
Please stop, Executive Director.

00:58:54.671 --> 00:58:56.240
At this point,

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.508
shouldn't you be the one
to break free from Mr. Kim?

00:58:59.343 --> 00:59:02.112
How long are you going to keep protecting
a man who's always hitting on women...

00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:05.215
just because he's your husband?

00:59:06.917 --> 00:59:08.785
You weren't like this before.

00:59:09.586 --> 00:59:11.855
You used to be colder
and more righteous than anyone.

00:59:12.522 --> 00:59:14.458
When I was a rookie, you told me this.

00:59:15.092 --> 00:59:18.095
"To you, it might just feel
like another one-hour broadcast,"

00:59:18.695 --> 00:59:21.498
"but for a partner company,
that one hour can make or break them."

00:59:21.498 --> 00:59:24.067
"So don't ever
treat that hour carelessly."

00:59:24.067 --> 00:59:25.736
"It's an hour
with someone's whole life on the line."

00:59:27.571 --> 00:59:30.040
From that day on, I respected you
and really looked up to you.

00:59:30.741 --> 00:59:32.910
For a long time, I wanted to be like you.

00:59:34.244 --> 00:59:35.312
How did someone like that...

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.215
end up changing like this?

00:59:40.484 --> 00:59:41.585
He's the father of my child.

00:59:43.754 --> 00:59:45.989
You're a mother too,
so you should be able to understand.

00:59:47.324 --> 00:59:49.126
Even if I'm torn to shreds,

00:59:49.559 --> 00:59:51.962
and my heart is ripped apart
with humiliation,

00:59:52.262 --> 00:59:53.297
I cannot let my daughter...

00:59:55.699 --> 00:59:57.801
be branded the child of a sex offender.

00:59:59.536 --> 01:00:01.672
Is it really so wrong for a mother
to try to protect her daughter?

01:00:02.773 --> 01:00:05.442
I really did everything I could.

01:00:05.442 --> 01:00:07.811
For my daughter, for my family, I truly...

01:00:07.811 --> 01:00:10.314
Was that really the choice
that was best for your daughter?

01:00:11.181 --> 01:00:13.784
Honestly, wasn't it you
who wanted to succeed?

01:00:17.454 --> 01:00:18.822
Your daughter...

01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:21.024
might actually have been in agony,

01:00:22.259 --> 01:00:25.028
watching her mother
protect a man like that.

01:00:28.432 --> 01:00:29.399
Even now,

01:00:30.901 --> 01:00:32.135
could you please go back...

01:00:33.236 --> 01:00:34.705
to the Executive Director...

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.208
I used to admire?

01:00:47.851 --> 01:00:51.154
(Ob-Gyn Clinic)

01:00:52.389 --> 01:00:53.991
What brings you in today?

01:00:54.791 --> 01:00:58.095
I was recently diagnosed
with early menopause,

01:00:58.095 --> 01:01:00.631
but I only went to one hospital,

01:01:00.631 --> 01:01:02.165
so I wondered if it might have been
a misdiagnosis.

01:01:02.733 --> 01:01:06.436
And recently, I had a bit of spotting.

01:01:06.436 --> 01:01:09.873
So I thought maybe I was mistaken
about not having had a period.

01:01:10.774 --> 01:01:12.276
Shall we start with an ultrasound?

01:01:12.809 --> 01:01:13.644
Yes.

01:01:26.356 --> 01:01:29.359
Unfortunately, it wasn't a misdiagnosis.

01:01:30.594 --> 01:01:32.296
Based on the ultrasound,

01:01:32.296 --> 01:01:33.664
it clearly appears to be menopause.

01:01:35.132 --> 01:01:37.801
You had your FSH levels checked
at the previous hospital, right?

01:01:38.502 --> 01:01:39.269
Yes.

01:01:39.269 --> 01:01:41.238
Occasional spotting can occur...

01:01:41.238 --> 01:01:43.273
when you're tired.

01:01:43.273 --> 01:01:44.608
It's a temporary symptom.

01:01:45.642 --> 01:01:47.177
Are you taking your medication
as prescribed?

01:01:49.746 --> 01:01:50.614
No.

01:01:50.614 --> 01:01:52.215
That won't do.

01:01:52.583 --> 01:01:55.419
If you don't take it,
you may start experiencing...

01:01:55.419 --> 01:01:58.355
menopausal symptoms
like insomnia or hot flashes.

01:01:58.889 --> 01:02:01.525
I strongly recommend
that you take your medicine regularly,

01:02:01.758 --> 01:02:03.193
don't skip meals,

01:02:03.193 --> 01:02:05.295
and take good care
of your overall condition.

01:02:32.623 --> 01:02:33.757
Has Joo Young gotten off work yet?

01:02:34.057 --> 01:02:35.993
She said she's working late tonight,
so she'll be home late.

01:02:35.993 --> 01:02:37.160
I see.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.195
You haven't had dinner, have you?

01:02:38.862 --> 01:02:40.731
I bought braised pig's trotters and soju.

01:02:41.698 --> 01:02:44.534
I was just thinking of eating something,
since I was getting hungry.

01:02:51.475 --> 01:02:52.309
What's this?

01:02:53.777 --> 01:02:54.945
Are you sick or something?

01:02:56.079 --> 01:02:58.282
No, it's not that I'm sick.

01:02:58.615 --> 01:03:01.652
I was just feeling tired,
so I bought some vitamins.

01:03:02.586 --> 01:03:03.487
Really?

01:03:03.887 --> 01:03:05.756
They even print the days of the week
on vitamins now?

01:03:07.791 --> 01:03:08.825
That's how they sell them now.

01:03:09.259 --> 01:03:10.160
All right, let's eat.

01:03:15.165 --> 01:03:18.902
How many times have I told you
not to stick your nose...

01:03:18.902 --> 01:03:21.038
in other people's business?

01:03:22.005 --> 01:03:23.006
But...

01:03:25.275 --> 01:03:27.010
if someone collapses right in front of me,

01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:28.345
how could I just stand there?
I have to help.

01:03:29.046 --> 01:03:30.581
Hey, why are you crying?

01:03:32.849 --> 01:03:33.684
It's just...

01:03:35.452 --> 01:03:37.120
the movie's sad.

01:03:40.123 --> 01:03:42.326
It's not even that sad of a movie.

01:03:45.095 --> 01:03:45.996
That's weird.

01:03:47.664 --> 01:03:48.899
It's sad to me.

01:03:51.101 --> 01:03:52.469
So sad.

01:03:58.642 --> 01:03:59.843
What's wrong with me?

01:04:02.079 --> 01:04:04.681
Il Ri, could it be
that time of the month for you?

01:04:05.282 --> 01:04:06.617
I'm not really sure,

01:04:06.617 --> 01:04:09.886
but they say women get a bit sensitive
around then.

01:04:09.886 --> 01:04:10.821
Are you okay?

01:04:12.189 --> 01:04:13.323
I guess so.

01:04:14.291 --> 01:04:15.359
It must be that time.

01:04:19.229 --> 01:04:20.397
But of all times...

01:04:21.598 --> 01:04:22.833
Of all times...

01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:25.802
Dear.

01:04:28.338 --> 01:04:29.339
Are you okay?

01:04:38.949 --> 01:04:39.850
It's okay.

(Ethics Committee)

01:05:06.743 --> 01:05:08.145
I'm intern Cho Na Jeong.

01:05:08.879 --> 01:05:09.746
Please have a seat.

01:05:15.218 --> 01:05:17.721
You're saying you want to retract
your testimony?

01:05:18.555 --> 01:05:19.356
Yes.

01:05:21.658 --> 01:05:22.559
The truth is,

01:05:23.093 --> 01:05:26.430
Show Host Kim Seon Min
and Producer Noh Won Bin...

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:28.532
are not having an affair.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.601
What?

01:05:31.602 --> 01:05:33.537
Then what about
the statement you made before?

01:05:36.173 --> 01:05:38.375
I'm very sorry to say this here,

01:05:38.642 --> 01:05:41.078
but that day I gave false testimony.

01:05:46.283 --> 01:05:49.586
Due to coercive threats and coaxing...

01:05:50.287 --> 01:05:52.122
from Division Head Kim Jeong Sik
and Executive Director Seo,

01:05:52.956 --> 01:05:54.591
I made a serious mistake.

01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:56.693
Our testimony
before the Ethics Committee...

01:05:57.027 --> 01:05:59.563
caused a major stir within the company.

01:06:09.506 --> 01:06:12.242
The key witness's testimony
has now been overturned,

01:06:12.643 --> 01:06:14.645
and additional circumstances
of sexual misconduct have come to light.

01:06:16.113 --> 01:06:18.815
Accordingly, by unanimous decision
of this Ethics Committee,

01:06:19.683 --> 01:06:21.451
we hereby notify you...

01:06:22.819 --> 01:06:23.854
of the dismissal
of Division Head Kim Jeong Sik.

01:06:24.821 --> 01:06:27.891
On charges of sexual harassment
in the workplace...

01:06:27.891 --> 01:06:30.527
and abuse of power,

01:06:30.527 --> 01:06:31.862
Division Head Kim Jeong Sik
has been dismissed effective immediately.

01:06:32.429 --> 01:06:35.232
(Executive Director Seo Gyeong Seon)

01:06:45.976 --> 01:06:49.279
The executive director took responsibility
for everything...

01:06:49.913 --> 01:06:51.448
and submitted her resignation.

01:06:59.089 --> 01:07:02.893
In the end,
even my husband was reinstated,

01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:06.296
and it seemed
as if everything had been set right again.

01:07:10.367 --> 01:07:13.470
But unexpectedly,

01:07:14.037 --> 01:07:17.207
another ugly truth
that shocked us all came to light.

01:07:20.377 --> 01:07:22.946
Hey, Cho Na Jeong, did you hear?

01:07:22.946 --> 01:07:24.147
Hear what?

01:07:24.748 --> 01:07:26.483
They say the police took away...

01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:28.285
Kim Jeong Sik and Mr. Kang.

01:07:29.152 --> 01:07:30.854
Why? What happened?

01:07:40.564 --> 01:07:43.800
Executive Director.

01:07:44.601 --> 01:07:47.004
Executive Director, are you all right?

01:07:47.571 --> 01:07:49.573
But it didn't end there.

01:07:50.374 --> 01:07:51.808
Once again,

01:07:51.808 --> 01:07:54.411
I had to face
another blow of misfortune...

01:07:54.411 --> 01:07:55.579
coming at me from behind.

01:07:55.846 --> 01:07:57.247
What do you mean by that?

01:07:57.247 --> 01:07:59.883
You mean one of our interns
might get fired?

01:07:59.883 --> 01:08:01.151
This morning,

01:08:01.151 --> 01:08:03.687
I overheard the general affairs team
talking in the break room.

01:08:03.687 --> 01:08:05.122
- Yeah.
- And...

01:08:05.122 --> 01:08:07.391
we've got seven interns in total, right?

01:08:07.391 --> 01:08:09.326
But they were saying that next month,
for some application,

01:08:09.326 --> 01:08:12.562
only six people would be applying
or something like that.

01:08:12.562 --> 01:08:14.298
So...

01:08:14.298 --> 01:08:16.833
I started getting nervous,
thinking maybe one of us...

01:08:16.833 --> 01:08:17.935
is going to get fired.

saying his dream was to have
a daughter who looks like me.

01:10:31.368 --> 01:10:32.936
