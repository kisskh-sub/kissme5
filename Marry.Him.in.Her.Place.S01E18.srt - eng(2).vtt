00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:24.692
Come up and sleep.

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:29.132
It's fine, I can manage.

00:01:30.012 --> 00:01:33.132
You're still injured,
and the floor is cold.

00:01:54.172 --> 00:01:56.731
How's it outside?

00:01:56.732 --> 00:01:59.132
Once it's daylight, if the dock
can send boats, we'll leave.

00:02:02.212 --> 00:02:04.851
Lin Yun, have you thought about it?

00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:06.636
After we leave Rong City,

00:02:06.637 --> 00:02:08.586
where do you want to go?

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:10.387
Wherever you want to go, we'll go.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.886
I want to...

00:02:13.887 --> 00:02:17.174
I want to find a small village
with mountains and rivers.

00:02:17.175 --> 00:02:18.894
Mountains full of camellias,

00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:20.134
and raise a flock of chickens.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.739

00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:30.649

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.970

00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:51.852
can we really escape?

00:02:56.037 --> 00:02:58.597
It's all my fault that you're involved.

00:03:00.452 --> 00:03:03.532
Fool, how could I ever blame you?

00:03:04.412 --> 00:03:05.892
Have you ever thought

00:03:06.132 --> 00:03:09.811
the first time I met you at the tailor shop,
you glanced back and smiled,

00:03:09.812 --> 00:03:11.772
and it already reached my heart?

00:03:12.887 --> 00:03:14.891
No matter what you become,

00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:16.972
I've always loved you.

00:03:30.212 --> 00:03:31.332
Stick close to me.

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:42.212
Stop!

00:03:42.692 --> 00:03:43.091
Stop!

00:03:43.092 --> 00:03:44.251
Have you seen this person?

00:03:44.252 --> 00:03:45.052
Move.

00:03:49.092 --> 00:03:51.692
Don't worry, I've arranged everything.

00:03:58.052 --> 00:03:59.732
You three, what are you doing?

00:04:03.962 --> 00:04:06.362
The boss is being targeted. Go quickly.

00:04:06.732 --> 00:04:07.451
Here.

00:04:07.452 --> 00:04:08.251

Stop! Don't run!

00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:11.531
Suspect spotted. Full pursuit!

What's happening?

00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:20.811
The police seized the boat.
They're coming here.

00:04:20.812 --> 00:04:22.131
You betrayed us?

00:04:22.132 --> 00:04:23.131
Not me.

00:04:23.132 --> 00:04:24.571
I wouldn't dare.

00:04:24.572 --> 00:04:25.852
If not you, then who?

00:04:42.037 --> 00:04:45.237
Wang Wu, it's you!

00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:48.274
How dare you betray us?

00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:50.075
What exactly did they offer you?

00:04:50.932 --> 00:04:53.771
Boss, just listen to me.

00:04:53.772 --> 00:04:55.291
You should surrender.

00:04:55.292 --> 00:04:56.171
Perhaps

00:04:56.172 --> 00:04:59.095
Mayor Song might let you leave
in one piece.

Now, no one is nagging you anymore.

00:06:59.732 --> 00:07:02.572
