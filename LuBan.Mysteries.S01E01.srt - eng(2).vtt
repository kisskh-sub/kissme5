00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.160
Once upon a time

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.559
there was Lu Ban, the ancestor of carpenters

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:21.079
He left behind a book called Lu Ban's Secret Art

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.800
It recorded all kinds of

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.719
astonishing and magical crafting techniques

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.759
But few people know

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.960
this secret art actually has two volumes, yin and yang

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.759
The upper volume records

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.119
ordinary, commonly seen craftsman skills

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:46.520
But as for the lower volume

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.600
it is filled entirely with

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:52.719
dark arts and secret spells unheard of before

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.280
Such as the Puppetry Art

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.359
the Soul-Slashing Art

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.759
and the Seven Stars Life-Extending Method

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:03.119
Those who employ these evil arts

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.719
will surely suffer backlash

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.599
Widower

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.319
Widow

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.040
Orphan

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.719
Solitary

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.640
Crippled

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.159
one misfortune is inevitable

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.879
Yet these so-called dark and demonic arts

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.359
are nothing but crooked, heretical paths

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:16.719
they cannot truly hold up

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.599
But some people perversely go against what is right

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:24.120
using evil secrets to fulfill selfish, wicked desires

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:27.000
Never knowing that Heaven's law is clear

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.599
retribution never misses

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.360
Help me

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.520
Help, help

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.479
Please save me

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.879
Help me

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.439
Save me, help

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.719
Stop the sedan

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.960
Move quickly

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.879
No, Officer

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.919
I am just an honest

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.599
small-time carpenter trying to make a living

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:58.680
I swear to you

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.719
I really have not done anything illegal

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.159
Cut the crap

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Good heavens

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.240
I did not do this

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.120
I really did not do this

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.480
These were not done by me

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.839
Look at those, see

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.439
even those there were not done by me

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:23.600
Li Mudun

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.519
Who says you did not do it

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.959
I did build this sedan chair

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.480
but I did not kill anyone

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.399
I usually do not even dare kill a chicken

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.720
You did not kill the person

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.120
but you made the sedan

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:38.959
so you are also suspected as an accomplice

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.920
How can that be

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.079
He is the one who did it

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.959
I heard all carpenters know Lu Ban's Secret Art

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.639
things like reverse-blade axe and weeping beam art

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:45.720
killing people without a trace

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:46.800
You are talking nonsense

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.279
In Lu Ban's Secret Art

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:50.000
all those twisted, evil tricks are fake

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.720
they were made up by people with bad intentions

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.319
How can you believe that stuff

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.439
He did not do it

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.000
It was the Weasel Spirit

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.040
Lately I heard that at Bei San Miao

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.279
people often see it eating offerings and worshipping the moon

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.480
causing trouble, snatching brides to marry

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.920
The Weasel Spirit killed the matchmaker

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.480
and carried off the bride

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.959
That is nonsense too

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:12.920
Officer

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.240
May I take a look at this sedan chair

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.399
to see if there is something wrong with it

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.040
How did the body twist all the way around

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:29.399
Lu Ban's Soul-Locking Axle

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.639
He actually used

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.120
a rotating lock mechanism to kill

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:35.000
The height of this sedan bottom is wrong too

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.879
Normally the base is one chi six cun high

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.040
Obviously

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.160
it is two cun higher

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.839
That is enough space to hide a person

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:41.759
And also

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.759
they used a Lu Ban's Mechanism Lock

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.680
The sedan body is made with

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:47.560
three cun thick locust wood

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.720
and a reverse locking mechanism

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.279
with dovetail tenon and sliding tenon

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.279
No joint lines left visible

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.680
and no gaps leaking ink

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:57.759
Could it be him

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.800
Who

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.720
I am not sure yet

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.279
But I am quite certain

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.199
this sedan chair was modified by someone

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:05.439
Stop investigating

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.160
He is definitely the killer

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.319
Take him back to the station

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.079
Let him drink a couple of kettles of it

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:10.199
He will confess everything then

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.560
Come on come on

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.720
Officer it definitely was not me

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.680
No way

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.279
Beating a confession out of someone without proof

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:17.639
makes you a disgrace to the police

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.879
Yang Zong

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.079
Do not forget

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.639
you have already been demoted and disciplined

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:23.800
Right now I am your boss

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:25.000
Know your place

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.759
Get lost

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.720
Move

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:28.639
Officer I

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.800
Unauthorized persons

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:47.680
are not allowed inside

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:49.639
Are your damn eyes blind

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:50.920
This is our director's daughter

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.839
Su Qingyun

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.240
She is still an unauthorized person

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.959
The director's daughter cannot enter

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.240
but a coroner can

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:58.160
My lady right now

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.199
is the director not holding

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.519
a welcome home banquet for you

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.759
What are you doing here then

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:02.839
What am I doing here

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.000
Of course I am here to examine the bodies

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:05.560
We are enough here for that

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:06.879
There is no need for you to come in person

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.959
If the director finds out

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.800
he will have my hide

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:09.759
These people are not dead yet

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.639
This is medically a hypothermic suspended state

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:13.680
Which means

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:14.920
under low temperature conditions

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:15.759
to stay alive

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:17.360
the body goes into a suppressed metabolism

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:18.639
The heartbeat slows

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:19.720
the body temperature drops

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.360
and they appear no different from the dead

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:22.439
Send them to the hospital quickly

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:24.240
Come on come on do as the lady says

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.000
Hurry hurry

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:25.800
Get them to the hospital

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.120
Come on

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.319
Hurry hurry

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:29.480
Miss Su

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.639
You really are amazing

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:39.560
My lady

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.399
Please hurry back

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.000
The director is already smashing cups

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:43.160
My lady

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:44.800
Let him smash them if he wants

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.120
He will not let me be a coroner

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.399
so I will make sure he sees

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.120
that whatever a man can do

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:50.639
a woman can do just the same

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:52.399
and even do it better

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:53.800
Uh

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.800
What are you standing there for

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:55.959
Repeat my exact words to him

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.639
My lady please be careful

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:12.399
Help me take this down

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.680
The deceased is about fifty years old

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.000
Around the neck

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.600
there are obvious external compression injuries

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:20.079
Cause of death is asphyxiation from strangling

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.879
There is a sedative agent in the nasal cavity

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:23.879
Judging by the degree of rigor mortis

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.959
time of death is as follows

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:27.079
It was around three o'clock early this morning

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.319
Three in the morning last night

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.120
Where were you

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.399
I was at home fast asleep

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.720
Then this wedding sedan

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:33.919
Who did you sell it to

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.159
Lao Yuan from the funeral shop

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.360
Lead the way

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.240
Miss Su

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.639
You are beautiful and kind

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:45.879
And you are highly professional

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.080
You do not flatter for no reason

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.080
Unless you are up to no good

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:49.240
If you have something to say just spit it out

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.639
I was demoted because I was framed

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:54.639
I hope you can recommend me to the chief

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.960
I want to explain in person

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.720
Me too

00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:58.559
Miss Su

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.360
You also know I was wronged

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:01.399
I am begging you

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.480
Please put in a good word for me

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.399
My wife and kid are still waiting for me at home

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:05.480
Thank you so much

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:06.879
Once the case is solved

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.039
We can talk about everything

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.159
Let us go

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.440
Wan Yan

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:33.639
I have already prepared everything for you

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.559
The sixth Megrez Life-Extending Lamp

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:39.519
Five days from now

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.279
I will gather all seven Life-Extending Lamps

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.440
And use the secret art to extend your life

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:47.399
Wan Yan

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.600
We can finally

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:51.799
Resume our fate together again

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:53.679
One lamp

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.440
Extends the living soul

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.399
Two lamps

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:59.240
Lock the gate of life

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.399
Three lamps

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.399
Connect to spirits and ghosts

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:05.919
Four lamps

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:08.559
Alter the stars

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:11.120
Li Mudun

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.320
It is your turn

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:25.639
Lao Yuan

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.120
Lao Yuan

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:30.000
Lao Yuan

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.480
Lao Yuan

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.600
This is clearly a wedding sedan shop

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:38.600
Why are there so many paper effigies

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.120
Where has everyone here gone

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.039
Lao Yuan

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:55.320
It is just one paper effigy is that necessary

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:58.720
It is not a paper effigy
