00:00:04.516 --> 00:00:05.586
(Episode 35)

00:00:05.646 --> 00:00:06.686
Woo Jin.

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:13.056
Woo Jin.

00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:19.026
Woo Jin. Don't do this.

00:00:19.826 --> 00:00:24.566
Woo Jin, don't do this. Woo Jin, don't! Seriously...

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:29.436
Woo Jin. Wake up. Woo Jin.

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:46.456
What?

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:48.956
How did you get here?

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.996
I came to save you.

00:00:57.936 --> 00:00:59.706
You're unbelievable.

00:01:00.906 --> 00:01:02.336
But still...

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:05.676
How could you throw your life away over someone like that?

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:12.846
I didn't have the will to live.

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:22.156
If you don't want to feel sorry for me,

00:01:25.596 --> 00:01:26.596
then live.

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:34.506
Let's go now, Woo Jin.

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:38.546
Please. Just leave me alone.

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:45.716
Now, I know...

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:48.316
who you are.

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:53.256
So what's the point of dying now?

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:55.556
Who are you trying to please by dying?

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:00.496
If you die because of her,

00:02:01.526 --> 00:02:02.666
you're a fool.

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:06.166
To me,

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:09.006
you're my friend, not her son.

00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:13.606
And if you die like this,

00:02:15.206 --> 00:02:17.516
it'll feel like I'm the one who killed you.

00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:27.526
So let's go,

00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:29.856
my brother.

00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:50.576
- Ma'am, Han Woo Jin is on his way. - You heard from him?

00:02:51.016 --> 00:02:52.016
Who called?

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:54.446
A woman?

00:02:57.456 --> 00:02:59.226
Understood. I'm on my way to the hospital.

00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:12.236
You two really are fated. I knew it. It's good you're back.

00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:17.976
Woo Jin. First, let's get you changed.

00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:19.346
Okay?

00:03:22.946 --> 00:03:23.946
What about you?

00:03:25.146 --> 00:03:26.686
I'll be admitted the day after tomorrow.

00:03:29.416 --> 00:03:30.656
Thank you, Eun Oh.

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:33.486
I'm not doing this because he's my brother.

00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:35.656
I'm doing it because he's my friend.

00:03:36.756 --> 00:03:38.126
I don't care what the reason is.

00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:40.796
Woo Jin's exhausted right now.

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:43.266
Don't pressure him or stress him out.

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:46.066
Do you think I have any energy left for that?

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:50.006
Woo Jin. You'll be okay without me, right?

00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:52.976
Eun Oh said she'd save me,

00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:55.246
so you can go now without worrying.

00:03:56.246 --> 00:03:57.316
And...

00:04:00.516 --> 00:04:02.316
I'd rather you didn't come back.

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:05.456
The doctor will be here soon.

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:09.526
- I'm leaving. - I'm posting a guard outside.

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:19.866
It's your sister.

00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:22.206
Eun Oh.

00:04:23.406 --> 00:04:24.406
Mom.

00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:27.246
I can't come home tonight.

00:04:28.876 --> 00:04:30.676
Woo Jin's in the hospital,

00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:34.546
- so I'm going to stay with him. - What?

00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:36.316
Wait, what's wrong with Woo Jin?

00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:39.986
He said he was going to Busan. Are you in Busan too?

00:04:43.226 --> 00:04:44.226
Mom.

00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:48.596
Woo Jin and I...

00:04:49.866 --> 00:04:50.966
Apparently, we're twins.

00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:54.436
Woo Jin is my older brother.

00:04:58.676 --> 00:04:59.876
What? What's wrong?

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.016
What? But...

00:05:05.486 --> 00:05:07.216
Eun Oh, what did you just say?

00:05:08.286 --> 00:05:10.756
Woo Jin... I mean, your friend, Woo Jin...

00:05:11.786 --> 00:05:13.656
He's your twin brother?

00:05:15.056 --> 00:05:16.426
What is she talking about?

00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:20.096
Mom.

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:22.836
For Woo Jin...

00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:26.006
Can I be his liver donor?

00:05:30.176 --> 00:05:31.376
You know, right?

00:05:32.576 --> 00:05:35.046
When I was struggling after Dad passed away,

00:05:37.116 --> 00:05:39.416
he's the only reason I got through it.

00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:42.716
I know.

00:05:44.686 --> 00:05:46.856
Woo Jin was at the funeral home for three straight days,

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:51.156
and he carried your bag for you twice a day for over a month.

00:05:51.956 --> 00:05:53.796
Ever since freshman year, he and Yeong In...

00:05:54.326 --> 00:05:57.466
were always over. Of course, I know.

00:05:59.636 --> 00:06:00.636
Mom.

00:06:02.876 --> 00:06:04.036
Please, can I?

00:06:19.856 --> 00:06:20.856
Hey.

00:06:21.286 --> 00:06:23.956
Since when do you do after-parties at a colleague's wedding?

00:06:25.726 --> 00:06:27.026
Honey.

00:06:32.836 --> 00:06:37.176
What's with you? You're so strict about no outside clothes on the bed.

00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:40.576
Oh, this feels nice.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:45.686
They insisted I stay for the party since it's been so long,

00:06:46.186 --> 00:06:48.856
but it was so exhausting listening to everyone.

00:06:50.256 --> 00:06:52.116
Well, you get those types everywhere.

00:06:52.986 --> 00:06:57.196
- Come here. You've had a long day. - Gosh, I love being home the most.

00:06:58.696 --> 00:06:59.766
Not me?

00:07:02.236 --> 00:07:05.096
You are my home.

00:07:09.606 --> 00:07:10.606
Did you find him?

00:07:11.606 --> 00:07:12.676
I found him.

00:07:13.246 --> 00:07:15.746
I'll bring your car back tomorrow morning.

00:07:17.746 --> 00:07:19.616
Yes, okay.

00:07:25.016 --> 00:07:26.126
So that was the right place.

00:07:28.526 --> 00:07:30.156
They say twins have a special connection.

00:07:31.756 --> 00:07:33.796
So that's why they became best friends.

00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:45.336
I'm glad they found each other.

00:07:49.916 --> 00:07:51.516
I guess Eun Oh will do the liver transplant.

00:07:52.046 --> 00:07:53.446
Knowing Eun Oh, she'll definitely do it for him.

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:56.416
But why do I have such a bad feeling about this?

00:08:00.086 --> 00:08:03.196
So, is the surgery happening on the original date?

00:08:04.626 --> 00:08:06.826
- I guess so. - Man...

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:10.136
Ji Hyuk, let's go visit her together after the surgery.

00:08:10.196 --> 00:08:13.606
Are you kidding me? I'm torn up, and you're already planning a visit?

00:08:14.636 --> 00:08:17.536
It's not like you can stop her. You just have to accept it.

00:08:19.376 --> 00:08:22.246
Yes, right. It must be nice you're over Eun Oh.

00:08:22.976 --> 00:08:24.076
You get to be all logical about it.

00:08:24.816 --> 00:08:25.846
Forget it, man. I'm hanging up.

00:08:29.016 --> 00:08:30.016
Man...

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.056
Ji Hyuk must be having such a hard time right now.

00:08:36.226 --> 00:08:37.226
What?

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:39.726
Hey, Su Bin.

00:08:40.266 --> 00:08:43.096
Hey, you're free on Wednesday night, right?

00:08:43.236 --> 00:08:44.336
Let me know right away.

00:08:44.766 --> 00:08:48.736
Seats just opened for that musical. I have to book them right away.

00:08:49.036 --> 00:08:50.676
Wednesday?

00:08:51.706 --> 00:08:53.206
I have plans on Wednesday.

00:08:53.206 --> 00:08:54.746
I have to visit a friend in the hospital.

00:08:55.176 --> 00:08:56.176
Let's go another day.

00:08:57.016 --> 00:08:58.616
You have a friend who's sick?

00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:00.946
What's wrong with them?

00:09:02.316 --> 00:09:05.386
- Can't you visit them the next day? - No, I can't.

00:09:05.686 --> 00:09:06.986
That's the day of the surgery.

00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:08.826
Really?

00:09:09.496 --> 00:09:10.626
Well, should I come with you?

00:09:11.526 --> 00:09:12.526
No.

00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:17.566
It's not someone you'd know.

00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:21.036
What do you mean, not someone I'd know?

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:23.536
Is it a girl?

00:09:24.436 --> 00:09:25.576
Well, yes, but...

00:09:26.206 --> 00:09:27.446
She's just a friend.

00:09:28.746 --> 00:09:29.746
Just a friend who's a girl?

00:09:30.676 --> 00:09:34.716
There's already someone I like. I've liked her for a long time.

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:36.416
I've clearly said no,

00:09:36.716 --> 00:09:38.386
and I told you there's someone else.

00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:43.096
So that "friend" in the hospital...

00:09:43.156 --> 00:09:44.796
Is she the girl you had a crush on for years?

00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:48.866
Did I really say all that?

00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:53.036
Yes, you did. When you rejected me and put up a wall.

00:09:56.476 --> 00:09:58.776
I thought you had just made it up to push me away,

00:09:59.176 --> 00:10:00.276
but it was real, wasn't it?

00:10:00.576 --> 00:10:03.346
Su Bin, hold on a second. Let me explain.

00:10:03.746 --> 00:10:07.116
She's having surgery? You're that worried about her?

00:10:08.046 --> 00:10:09.056
Fine.

00:10:10.056 --> 00:10:11.786
Su Bin. Wait, I...

00:10:13.186 --> 00:10:14.186
Hello?

00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:20.026
I don't have feelings for her anymore.

00:10:23.866 --> 00:10:27.236
The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to voicemail...

00:10:27.306 --> 00:10:28.366
Please leave your message...

00:10:28.936 --> 00:10:32.476
Su Bin, why are you so angry? You didn't even hear me out.

00:10:33.106 --> 00:10:34.746
Call me. I'll explain everything.

00:10:45.456 --> 00:10:46.456
Son.

00:10:47.586 --> 00:10:50.496
What kind of part-time jobs have you been doing lately?

00:10:51.096 --> 00:10:54.926
Just odd jobs here and there. I don't have a steady one.

00:10:55.396 --> 00:10:58.866
I've just been going on interviews, so I can't commit to a steady job.

00:11:01.666 --> 00:11:04.376
It must be all physical labour, starting at dawn.

00:11:04.976 --> 00:11:06.946
That's why he's covered in all those pain patches.

00:11:08.346 --> 00:11:09.746
Go on inside and get some rest, Mother.

00:11:20.026 --> 00:11:22.456
Grandma. What are you doing out here?

00:11:22.856 --> 00:11:25.226
Oh? Listen, Su Bin.

00:11:25.596 --> 00:11:28.766
Tomorrow, go and see your mom at the store.

00:11:29.296 --> 00:11:31.066
That bed thing I was lying on at the store...

00:11:31.466 --> 00:11:34.206
Could you discreetly ask her how much it costs?

00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:39.246
- Why? - Because it felt so amazing.

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:45.346
Your dad's been covered in pain patches lately.

00:11:46.416 --> 00:11:48.146
I'm going to save up.

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:50.256
For your dad's birthday next year,

00:11:51.016 --> 00:11:52.316
I'm thinking of buying him one.

00:11:53.486 --> 00:11:55.726
Grandma. Does it make you sad?

00:11:58.696 --> 00:12:01.426
It just breaks my heart. He's my son.

00:12:04.666 --> 00:12:07.266
Grandma, do you want to have a beer with me?

00:12:07.766 --> 00:12:11.636
- I'm on my way to get some now. - Oh, no. I couldn't possibly.

00:12:12.076 --> 00:12:14.946
I'm a model about to walk the runway.

00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:17.716
I can't have a puffy face. It would be a disaster.

00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:20.786
I'm even planning on fasting starting tomorrow night.

00:12:30.296 --> 00:12:31.296
Lee Su Bin.

00:12:34.366 --> 00:12:36.236
What are you doing wandering around so late?

00:12:37.566 --> 00:12:38.796
With your phone off, no less.

00:12:40.206 --> 00:12:41.666
Is it really something to get so angry about?

00:12:45.136 --> 00:12:47.576
Angry enough to come out for four beers this late at night?

00:12:47.706 --> 00:12:51.516
Forget 4 beers. I could drink 4 bottles of soju now.

00:12:57.916 --> 00:12:58.956
Seong Jae.

00:12:59.256 --> 00:13:01.356
You only asked me out to get over her, didn't you?

00:13:02.526 --> 00:13:04.826
What? That's ridiculous.

00:13:05.296 --> 00:13:08.426
She's a friend having major surgery. That's why I'm visiting her.

00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:10.296
Why are you jumping to conclusions like that?

00:13:10.866 --> 00:13:12.266
This isn't going to work if you're like this.

00:13:13.206 --> 00:13:16.406
- "Isn't going to work?" - I have a social life, you know.

00:13:16.806 --> 00:13:19.876
Why get mad and make assumptions without even hearing me out?

00:13:20.176 --> 00:13:24.176
It's not just your "social life." You had a crush on her for years.

00:13:24.516 --> 00:13:26.946
- Not anymore. - Yes, right.

00:13:27.216 --> 00:13:29.486
You're going because you still like her, aren't you?

00:13:29.756 --> 00:13:31.156
And you don't want me to come with you.

00:13:31.486 --> 00:13:32.486
What?

00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:37.896
Su Bin.

00:13:43.566 --> 00:13:45.666
I was told that Mt. Cheongah, where the cabin is,

00:13:46.636 --> 00:13:48.566
is where Dad's ashes were scattered.

00:13:50.736 --> 00:13:51.776
I see.

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:53.976
So that's why...

00:13:54.746 --> 00:13:57.076
you said you went there every year on your birthday.

00:14:02.116 --> 00:14:03.986
Looking back on it now, Eun Oh...

00:14:05.256 --> 00:14:06.256
For my entire life,

00:14:07.356 --> 00:14:09.996
I've never been able to forget the moment we parted ways...

00:14:12.156 --> 00:14:13.166
because I felt so guilty.

00:14:18.896 --> 00:14:21.036
But it was a blessing in disguise for you.

00:14:24.306 --> 00:14:25.776
I know...

00:14:26.206 --> 00:14:28.346
how loved you were growing up...

00:14:30.276 --> 00:14:34.086
and how warm and wonderful your parents were.

00:14:39.556 --> 00:14:40.556
You're right.

00:14:43.156 --> 00:14:44.556
But when you put it that way,

00:14:46.226 --> 00:14:47.896
it makes you sound so pitiful.

00:14:57.636 --> 00:14:59.176
Eun Oh's so thin.

00:15:00.906 --> 00:15:03.276
Gosh, and she's so frail.

00:15:24.766 --> 00:15:25.766
Eun Oh.

00:15:26.766 --> 00:15:28.606
Thank you. It was a huge help.

00:15:29.206 --> 00:15:30.206
Sure.

00:15:32.506 --> 00:15:35.846
This is my leave request.

00:15:37.116 --> 00:15:39.246
Only for two weeks this time.

00:15:40.246 --> 00:15:41.246
Shorter this time, right?

00:15:43.586 --> 00:15:46.056
I don't think I can approve this.

00:15:48.356 --> 00:15:50.396
Come on. You know what this is for.

00:15:50.656 --> 00:15:53.826
You look so thin and frail. You have no energy.

00:15:54.526 --> 00:15:56.196
You always push yourself so hard...

00:15:56.196 --> 00:15:58.036
and constantly pull all-nighters. Also,

00:15:58.396 --> 00:16:02.336
how can your liver be healthy when you live on triangle gimbap?

00:16:02.776 --> 00:16:05.036
The tests already proved I'm a suitable match.

00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:08.276
- That I'm perfectly healthy. - I know, but still...

00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:09.376
Mr. Lee.

00:16:09.876 --> 00:16:13.786
I'll outline the new project while I'm in the hospital.

00:16:14.986 --> 00:16:17.656
I'll have nothing to do but think until I'm discharged anyway.

00:16:22.756 --> 00:16:24.096
(Leave Request)

00:16:26.056 --> 00:16:27.066
Eun Oh.

00:16:29.896 --> 00:16:31.296
I'll take the compatibility test.

00:16:33.466 --> 00:16:35.636
I'm way healthier than you are.

00:16:36.706 --> 00:16:38.436
Why didn't I think of that?

00:16:40.446 --> 00:16:44.416
I'm glad we're back to being just colleagues.

00:16:45.846 --> 00:16:48.416
I never thought I'd feel this comforted by you.

00:16:51.286 --> 00:16:54.456
I'll start my leave tomorrow.

00:17:12.636 --> 00:17:15.406
My friend isn't in very good health right now.

00:17:15.846 --> 00:17:18.616
I'd like to see if I'm a match for the liver donation.

00:17:19.246 --> 00:17:23.556
You can't get tested without proof of family or close ties.

00:17:23.956 --> 00:17:26.826
We can't do elective testing unless it's for a deceased donation.

00:17:27.356 --> 00:17:28.356
I know that.

00:17:28.886 --> 00:17:32.526
I'm close with the donor, Ji Eun Oh. We're colleagues.

00:17:32.996 --> 00:17:35.866
I'm close with the patient's sister, so can't I get the test?

00:17:36.126 --> 00:17:38.336
That kind of indirect relationship doesn't qualify.

00:17:38.436 --> 00:17:40.736
But I want to help someone sick. Why can't I?

00:17:41.036 --> 00:17:42.666
You need proof that you've lived together...

00:17:42.666 --> 00:17:44.306
as close acquaintances for a long time,

00:17:44.376 --> 00:17:46.676
and your case still needs approval by the Transplant Ethics Committee.

00:17:50.046 --> 00:17:51.046
I see.

00:17:52.986 --> 00:17:54.586
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:17:54.646 --> 00:17:57.286
The person you have called is unavailable.

00:17:58.916 --> 00:18:00.356
She's still not picking up?

00:18:04.796 --> 00:18:07.896
Su Bin. I'm getting off on the dot, so let's meet up and talk.

00:18:07.966 --> 00:18:10.796
(Su Bin. I'm getting off on the dot, so let's meet up and talk.)

00:18:14.006 --> 00:18:15.966
I have to film my grandma's walking practice tonight.

00:18:16.036 --> 00:18:18.806
(I have to film my grandma's walking practice tonight.)

00:18:20.976 --> 00:18:22.446
Let's meet for a bit at lunch.

00:18:22.506 --> 00:18:25.276
(Let's meet for a bit at lunch.)

00:18:28.016 --> 00:18:29.016
I'm busy.

00:18:29.086 --> 00:18:31.386
(I'm busy.)

00:18:33.356 --> 00:18:34.786
Darn it, Su Bin.

00:18:36.856 --> 00:18:38.896
- Seong Jae! - Ji Hyuk!

00:18:40.526 --> 00:18:41.796
Gosh, you scared me.

00:18:42.126 --> 00:18:45.396
Why can't I be of any help to Eun Oh?

00:18:47.036 --> 00:18:49.006
What's got you so worked up?

00:18:52.476 --> 00:18:56.746
Wait, you went to the hospital knowing not just anyone can take it?

00:18:57.216 --> 00:18:59.846
Well, since I'm a close colleague of hers,

00:18:59.916 --> 00:19:03.416
I figured they'd cut me some slack if I said I knew her brother too.

00:19:04.016 --> 00:19:07.086
Okay, and? Let's just say it was possible.

00:19:08.056 --> 00:19:10.196
Were you really going to donate your liver?

00:19:10.526 --> 00:19:11.856
Of course, I was.

00:19:12.326 --> 00:19:13.396
Hey, are you serious?

00:19:13.996 --> 00:19:15.966
What would your parents do if they found out?

00:19:17.066 --> 00:19:21.366
That's a problem I'll think about after I'm confirmed as a match.

00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:24.876
Man, you'd really do it, wouldn't you?

00:19:25.376 --> 00:19:27.046
It's not about me donating.

00:19:27.676 --> 00:19:30.346
It's just the thought of Eun Oh on that operating table...

00:19:30.616 --> 00:19:32.776
It drives me crazy with worry.

00:19:34.946 --> 00:19:36.146
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

00:19:37.656 --> 00:19:40.456
But how could she not know her son and Ji Eun Oh were friends?

00:19:42.256 --> 00:19:45.626
Man, she pays zero attention to her son.

00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:47.966
I know, right?

00:19:48.426 --> 00:19:52.236
I mean, your mom still remembers all your college friends, right?

00:19:52.796 --> 00:19:54.866
Yes. Most moms know all that stuff.

00:19:55.306 --> 00:19:57.906
But this woman... She's been seeing Eun Oh for months,

00:19:57.976 --> 00:19:59.746
and she still had no idea she was her son's friend.

00:20:00.606 --> 00:20:01.606
Hey.

00:20:02.406 --> 00:20:05.676
So in the end, she got exactly what she wanted, didn't she?

00:20:06.646 --> 00:20:11.486
She tricked Eun Oh. On top of that, she kept showing up and begging,

00:20:11.686 --> 00:20:13.356
and eventually got her to agree to the liver transplant.

00:20:14.026 --> 00:20:16.286
You think she's creepy even though you've never met her, right?

00:20:16.286 --> 00:20:17.896
I've met her twice.

00:20:18.156 --> 00:20:21.126
That woman has no shame.

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:25.936
The twin brother gets a pass. He's innocent in all this.

00:20:27.206 --> 00:20:28.206
But you...

00:20:29.066 --> 00:20:30.636
Are you just going to let her get away with it?

00:20:32.136 --> 00:20:34.406
I've thought about it, but there's nothing I can do.

00:20:34.706 --> 00:20:36.176
It's not like I can take her to court.

00:20:36.776 --> 00:20:39.516
Gosh, I want to punch her so badly,

00:20:40.016 --> 00:20:41.246
but she's Eun Oh's birth mother.

00:20:41.246 --> 00:20:42.516
Why do you say there's nothing you can do?

00:20:43.086 --> 00:20:44.286
You said she remarried, right?

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:45.856
What about her husband?

00:20:46.116 --> 00:20:48.426
Tell him his wife left her daughter...

00:20:48.426 --> 00:20:51.096
and came back just for her liver. You don't think that'll work?

00:20:51.556 --> 00:20:54.826
Hey, he probably knows already. Birds of a feather flock together.

00:20:57.096 --> 00:20:59.096
Yes, you're probably right about that.

00:21:00.366 --> 00:21:03.176
And you said that family was pretty well-off, right?

00:21:03.906 --> 00:21:05.536
Ji Hyuk, you should look into their background.

00:21:06.236 --> 00:21:10.446
We should tell everyone they know the truth about that trashy couple.

00:21:25.196 --> 00:21:26.426
Are you getting sleepy?

00:21:36.266 --> 00:21:37.936
No, it's not that.

00:21:38.106 --> 00:21:41.346
I'm just sore from not moving for so long.

00:21:41.546 --> 00:21:42.676
Then go and work out.

00:21:42.746 --> 00:21:45.746
No way. How could I leave you alone? I'm your bodyguard, after all.

00:21:46.446 --> 00:21:48.716
I'll just go stretch out front for a bit.

00:21:50.256 --> 00:21:54.156
Hey, when we were getting my table on Yeolmu,

00:21:54.386 --> 00:21:56.796
we saw that ten-dollar desk. I wonder if it sold.

00:21:57.326 --> 00:21:58.526
A desk? Why?

00:21:59.726 --> 00:22:01.726
You should have a desk, too.

00:22:02.366 --> 00:22:04.196
Sitting on the sofa for that long is bad for your back.

00:22:04.336 --> 00:22:08.136
No, it's fine. I can just go stretch and jump some rope out front.

00:22:08.766 --> 00:22:13.446
No, really. I need an assistant, especially when I'm stuck.

00:22:14.146 --> 00:22:15.206
An assistant?

00:22:16.006 --> 00:22:18.376
I mean, you and I are already creating the story together.

00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:24.286
Good work.

00:22:57.686 --> 00:22:58.856
I'm home.

00:23:01.326 --> 00:23:02.326
Where's Dad?

00:23:03.126 --> 00:23:05.526
He's on his way. He should be here any minute.

00:23:06.196 --> 00:23:07.196
Sit.

00:23:08.796 --> 00:23:09.796
Okay.

00:23:19.436 --> 00:23:20.446
Sit down.

00:23:21.146 --> 00:23:22.746
What is all this?

00:23:23.616 --> 00:23:24.876
When I said I'd clear your studio,

00:23:24.876 --> 00:23:26.586
you boldly told me to get rid of the studio,

00:23:26.646 --> 00:23:28.486
and now you get a room together?

00:23:30.086 --> 00:23:32.886
I heard you two would go in there and stay for hours.

00:23:33.556 --> 00:23:36.626
You hired someone to secretly take pictures of us?

00:23:36.626 --> 00:23:37.626
Answer my question first.

00:23:38.996 --> 00:23:41.496
You think I can let this slide and not fire Lee Ji Wan?

00:23:42.496 --> 00:23:44.866
You think I can keep this from your father?

00:23:46.936 --> 00:23:48.036
Well...

00:23:49.636 --> 00:23:50.636
What do I do?

00:23:51.536 --> 00:23:52.776
Dad's on his way?

00:23:54.806 --> 00:23:56.506
Stall for time. Pretend to think.

00:24:03.916 --> 00:24:05.786
Make a choice before Dad gets home.

00:24:06.286 --> 00:24:07.956
I'm giving you a chance to make these photos go away.

00:24:10.196 --> 00:24:13.266
In exchange, Lee Ji Wan must submit his own resignation.

00:24:23.506 --> 00:24:25.406
- You're home. - Yes.

00:24:25.676 --> 00:24:27.306
- And perfect timing, Yeong Ra is... - Yes?

00:24:32.446 --> 00:24:35.086
- Hi, Dad. You're home. - Hey. You're home early too.

00:24:35.386 --> 00:24:37.886
- I left something here. - What's that?

00:24:38.356 --> 00:24:39.486
- Dad. - Yes?

00:24:39.486 --> 00:24:41.326
I have something for you.

00:24:45.196 --> 00:24:46.296
Please open it.

00:24:48.626 --> 00:24:49.666
Mom, please have a seat.

00:25:00.306 --> 00:25:01.546
You can open yours too, Mom.

00:25:06.746 --> 00:25:08.316
Yeong Ra, what is this?

00:25:08.886 --> 00:25:12.756
- Park Yeong Ra's Art Studio? - Dad. Mom.

00:25:13.456 --> 00:25:15.926
I got a studio with my own money.

00:25:17.926 --> 00:25:20.526
- A studio? - What do you mean, a studio?

00:25:22.766 --> 00:25:25.796
The art studio I had was for when I dreamed of becoming an artist.

00:25:25.866 --> 00:25:28.166
It was you who spared no expense decorating it for me, Mom.

00:25:29.506 --> 00:25:31.476
But even though I'm not going to be an artist anymore,

00:25:31.736 --> 00:25:34.776
I felt like I'd just get lazy if I stayed at home all day.

00:25:36.976 --> 00:25:41.886
Dad, the deposit is 3,000 dollars, and the rent is only 350 a month.

00:25:45.116 --> 00:25:47.356
Mr. Lee even helped me paint it.

00:25:49.756 --> 00:25:51.356
But please don't give him a hard time.

00:25:51.656 --> 00:25:54.426
Until I had a chance to tell you,

00:25:54.496 --> 00:25:57.166
I begged him to keep it an absolute secret.

00:25:58.136 --> 00:25:59.566
So what are you going to do there?

00:26:00.806 --> 00:26:02.666
Exactly.

00:26:04.206 --> 00:26:07.746
Whether I open a gallery or do something else down the line,

00:26:08.446 --> 00:26:12.646
I'll go there at a set time daily to study, read books,

00:26:12.716 --> 00:26:15.986
and take some lessons. I'll do some painting, too.

00:26:17.516 --> 00:26:18.786
In short,

00:26:19.316 --> 00:26:21.826
it's my own personal studio for life.

00:26:24.426 --> 00:26:27.526
A 3,000-dollar deposit and 350 dollars a month.

00:26:29.596 --> 00:26:31.266
You didn't discuss this with your mom?

00:26:31.996 --> 00:26:33.296
You didn't know about this either?

00:26:34.706 --> 00:26:36.506
I kept it a secret on purpose.

00:26:38.806 --> 00:26:40.306
It was more exciting that way.

00:26:41.706 --> 00:26:43.876
I wanted to accomplish something on my own...

00:26:44.276 --> 00:26:46.416
and make Mom proud.

00:26:48.286 --> 00:26:51.156
She always pulls these stunts in front of her father.

00:26:58.726 --> 00:27:02.726
Why get rid of her good studio just to have her rent a tiny room?

00:27:03.536 --> 00:27:05.036
You know very well why.

00:27:05.466 --> 00:27:09.206
When I suggested closing the studio, she said it was fine.

00:27:10.036 --> 00:27:14.306
You never know what kids think. I don't get why she's like this.

00:27:14.376 --> 00:27:15.776
She's changed so much.

00:27:16.546 --> 00:27:17.946
She has changed a bit.

00:27:18.976 --> 00:27:20.546
So, what should we do?

00:27:21.246 --> 00:27:23.656
She's not wrong.

00:27:24.016 --> 00:27:26.926
She's happy she did it on her own, so what can we do?

00:27:27.586 --> 00:27:30.056
She must be tired of being stuck at home all day.

00:27:30.656 --> 00:27:34.996
But that doesn't mean she can do whatever she pleases.

00:27:35.466 --> 00:27:38.166
And Mr. Lee helping her paint bothers me.

00:27:38.466 --> 00:27:39.766
What's so bothersome about that?

00:27:40.606 --> 00:27:44.176
Come on, our Yeong Ra is beautiful, and he's a young man in his prime.

00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:49.176
She's out of his league, forbidden fruit.

00:27:49.246 --> 00:27:51.716
Those sayings exist for a reason.

00:27:51.916 --> 00:27:54.946
The guy is sharp enough to know where he stands.

00:27:55.586 --> 00:27:59.386
He's Seong Jae's friend's brother. He wouldn't dare try anything.

00:28:00.356 --> 00:28:05.156
Still, I have to keep an eye on her. It doesn't help that she's pretty.

00:28:14.436 --> 00:28:17.606
You're not the Yeong Ra I thought I knew.

00:28:19.276 --> 00:28:21.976
And who was the person you thought you knew, Mom?

00:28:23.876 --> 00:28:26.746
Someone who gets why I cherished you and raised you the way I did.

00:28:27.946 --> 00:28:31.016
Someone who knows why she has to live the way I tell her to.

00:28:32.056 --> 00:28:34.386
Someone who doesn't act so foolishly like you're doing now.

00:28:37.056 --> 00:28:40.026
So that's how you saw me.

00:28:40.766 --> 00:28:43.066
That's who you really are, Yeong Ra.

00:28:43.636 --> 00:28:46.036
I see you that way because that's who you are.

00:28:47.336 --> 00:28:49.336
I'm not so sure about that.

00:28:50.136 --> 00:28:52.076
I feel like I'm still the same person.

00:28:53.706 --> 00:28:56.746
Mom. Would you and Dad like to come see the studio?

00:28:58.346 --> 00:28:59.916
So you plan to use my weakness against me...

00:28:59.916 --> 00:29:02.346
to run around with Mr. Lee.

00:29:03.786 --> 00:29:05.856
Why has she changed so much?

00:29:06.686 --> 00:29:08.856
If I let this go on any longer, things will get out of hand.

00:29:15.026 --> 00:29:16.026
I'm busy.

00:29:18.396 --> 00:29:20.036
My gosh, what's with her?

00:29:21.166 --> 00:29:24.706
What am I supposed to do? I can't exactly ask Eun Oh,

00:29:24.776 --> 00:29:26.576
and I can't ask Ji Hyuk either.

00:29:27.046 --> 00:29:28.076
Seong Jae.

00:29:28.606 --> 00:29:31.046
You only asked me out to get over her, didn't you?

00:29:31.116 --> 00:29:33.546
You're going because you still like her, aren't you?

00:29:33.886 --> 00:29:35.416
And you don't want me to come with you.

00:29:37.256 --> 00:29:39.286
How did she jump to that just from me saying I was visiting Eun Oh?

00:29:43.556 --> 00:29:45.526
You jumped to your own conclusions and got mad,

00:29:45.896 --> 00:29:47.826
so why won't you even apologise, Su Bin?

00:29:47.826 --> 00:29:49.226
(Seong Jae)

00:29:49.226 --> 00:29:50.466
You want me to apologise?

00:29:50.796 --> 00:29:52.366
Are you saying I'm the one in the wrong?

00:29:54.736 --> 00:29:57.136
I guess I didn't know you as well as I thought.

00:29:57.806 --> 00:30:01.076
Let's take a break. I'll reach out when I'm ready.

00:30:01.176 --> 00:30:03.206
Don't contact me until then.

00:30:08.546 --> 00:30:10.356
Wow, I guess she's really mad.

00:30:11.916 --> 00:30:13.116
She's never...

00:30:13.486 --> 00:30:15.356
She's not the type to get this angry.

00:30:16.256 --> 00:30:17.996
What did I do that was so wrong?

00:30:19.926 --> 00:30:21.226
What should I do?

00:30:22.196 --> 00:30:24.236
Should I ask her for a deadline?

00:30:25.096 --> 00:30:26.596
Well, no.

00:30:28.006 --> 00:30:29.466
Gosh, what do I do?

00:30:34.646 --> 00:30:35.646
Mom.

00:30:36.606 --> 00:30:38.746
Why are you... Why? Why would you go in there?

00:30:38.816 --> 00:30:43.446
She's packing for the hospital all by herself.

00:30:45.716 --> 00:30:46.716
Mom.

00:30:48.056 --> 00:30:51.796
Now that we've accepted this, let's make her feel less guilty.

00:30:52.526 --> 00:30:54.896
How's she supposed to pack for the hospital stay with you?

00:30:54.966 --> 00:30:56.026
Eun Oh can't do that.

00:30:59.436 --> 00:31:02.866
I can't believe how thoughtful she is.

00:31:11.076 --> 00:31:13.946
Grandma's nude-coloured underwear, check.

00:31:14.016 --> 00:31:18.056
The schedule, wet wipes, and hairpins. All packed.

00:31:18.116 --> 00:31:20.456
You did a great job packing. Thank you.

00:31:21.326 --> 00:31:25.326
Hey, is everyone gone now? Is our secret safe?

00:31:26.196 --> 00:31:28.496
Of course. My lips are sealed.

00:31:28.566 --> 00:31:30.696
Besides Mom and me, no one else in the family knows.

00:31:31.666 --> 00:31:35.566
- This feels unreal. Let's go. - Let's go.

00:31:37.676 --> 00:31:40.476
All right, this is our visit for the "30 Homes" project.

00:31:40.546 --> 00:31:43.306
Keep the project concept in mind as we look around.

00:31:44.416 --> 00:31:46.246
I've already informed the showroom.

00:31:46.716 --> 00:31:49.446
Cheol Min. Come with us.

00:31:49.946 --> 00:31:50.956
Me?

00:31:51.156 --> 00:31:53.486
(Younglim, Kitchen, Bath, Home and Living)

00:31:53.686 --> 00:31:56.786
(Younglim Industries Co., Ltd)

00:31:56.986 --> 00:31:58.156
Wait, Eun Oh.

00:31:58.956 --> 00:32:02.496
Eun Oh, why are you here? Doesn't your leave start today?

00:32:03.396 --> 00:32:06.136
I forgot today was the first day of the Sample House project.

00:32:06.436 --> 00:32:08.066
They said I could check in this afternoon instead.

00:32:11.306 --> 00:32:13.306
We'll go on ahead and look around.

00:32:13.636 --> 00:32:14.706
Okay.

00:32:19.476 --> 00:32:22.146
You aren't avoiding the hospital because you're scared, are you?

00:32:23.146 --> 00:32:26.656
Even post-surgery, I can still use my brain while I'm in the hospital.

00:32:26.886 --> 00:32:29.786
And to do that, I need to see and feel the materials for myself.

00:32:30.856 --> 00:32:34.026
Come on, you could've just asked for photos and videos.

00:32:35.096 --> 00:32:37.666
Your team is waiting. Go on.

00:32:55.646 --> 00:32:56.686
Eun Oh.

00:32:57.616 --> 00:32:59.186
Getting any inspiration?

00:32:59.816 --> 00:33:04.056
Yes. It feels so different from when I came here with a client.

00:33:04.356 --> 00:33:07.296
I just look at all these materials...

00:33:07.366 --> 00:33:10.126
- and picture a house with these. - Exactly.

00:33:10.536 --> 00:33:14.166
With our materials, you can match colour tones over different textures,

00:33:14.306 --> 00:33:17.136
which allows for dozens of unique interior design possibilities.

00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:20.606
Getting that point across is the key to this project.

00:33:22.376 --> 00:33:24.846
Go on ahead. I'll just look around a bit more.

00:33:25.516 --> 00:33:26.516
Okay.

00:33:36.126 --> 00:33:39.496
But for the built-in closet, I've chosen one from another firm.

00:33:39.956 --> 00:33:41.596
I see, but even if they're both ivory,

00:33:41.866 --> 00:33:44.396
the shade might not match our kitchen cabinets.

00:33:45.196 --> 00:33:46.896
Even if they're both ivory?

00:33:47.166 --> 00:33:48.936
There are many different shades of ivory.

00:33:49.366 --> 00:33:51.506
If you use our company's products for everything,

00:33:51.576 --> 00:33:53.846
the tone throughout your home will match seamlessly and easily,

00:33:54.076 --> 00:33:55.146
making it the more sensible choice.

00:33:55.206 --> 00:33:59.516
I see your point. Do you have doors in the same colour?

00:34:00.216 --> 00:34:01.346
Of course, we do.

00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:03.016
(Younglim)

00:34:10.756 --> 00:34:15.066
(Achieve a cohesive look with a wide variety of materials.)

00:34:21.066 --> 00:34:22.736
What do you mean Eun Oh is postponing her admission?

00:34:24.636 --> 00:34:25.636
Because of work?

00:34:29.206 --> 00:34:30.206
I see.

00:34:33.676 --> 00:34:35.986
Work, all of a sudden? What kind of work?

00:34:36.546 --> 00:34:38.286
As if her job is more important right now.

00:34:41.486 --> 00:34:43.386
She just loves to wear people out.

00:34:44.296 --> 00:34:46.526
She just has to make people worry over nothing.

00:34:48.326 --> 00:34:49.566
You know, it's strange.

00:34:50.066 --> 00:34:52.496
- What is? - I'm not nervous at all today.

00:34:53.396 --> 00:34:57.506
Last time, I was so afraid they'd learn we're not real doctors.

00:34:58.406 --> 00:35:00.306
See? This is how you go from a one-time crook to a pro.

00:35:02.306 --> 00:35:06.316
But you don't think we'll find Mom in Woo Jin's room, do you?

00:35:06.746 --> 00:35:10.656
Who cares? I can go in first and scope it out.

00:35:12.486 --> 00:35:14.386
This is exactly why we need a tracker.

00:35:14.986 --> 00:35:17.996
And here you are, after bravely telling them about your new studio.

00:35:18.396 --> 00:35:20.626
- You forgot? - Right.

00:35:21.466 --> 00:35:23.666
"Why can't I visit Woo Jin?"

00:35:24.336 --> 00:35:25.666
I said I'd just ask her directly.

00:35:28.006 --> 00:35:30.736
I feel like my instincts keep pulling me back to Mom's prison.

00:35:42.486 --> 00:35:43.886
Could you please step out for a minute?

00:35:44.756 --> 00:35:46.616
I need to speak with the patient for a moment.

00:35:46.716 --> 00:35:47.756
Sure.

00:35:52.896 --> 00:35:53.896
Mr. Han Woo Jin.

00:35:59.336 --> 00:36:00.336
Yeong Ra?

00:36:07.876 --> 00:36:09.576
You were following Mom?

00:36:10.846 --> 00:36:11.846
You tailed her?

00:36:12.346 --> 00:36:13.346
Why?

00:36:13.946 --> 00:36:16.716
You don't need to know all the messy details.

00:36:16.986 --> 00:36:17.986
It'll just give you a headache.

00:36:19.116 --> 00:36:20.586
But why are you here?

00:36:21.726 --> 00:36:22.756
What do you mean, why?

00:36:23.626 --> 00:36:24.756
Besides Mom,

00:36:24.756 --> 00:36:26.656
I'm the only one in the family who knows about your major surgery.

00:36:30.266 --> 00:36:31.366
I wanted to come see you.

00:36:37.106 --> 00:36:38.106
Family?

00:36:39.976 --> 00:36:41.006
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:36:43.176 --> 00:36:46.676
You won't tell Mom I was here, right?

00:36:48.146 --> 00:36:49.646
Just try not to get caught yourself.

00:36:51.316 --> 00:36:52.316
Hurry up and go.

00:36:53.086 --> 00:36:54.156
Don't come back again.

00:36:57.086 --> 00:36:59.696
You don't want me to be here?

00:37:01.696 --> 00:37:02.766
It's not that.

00:37:03.726 --> 00:37:05.966
You know you'll be in huge trouble if Mom finds out.

00:37:07.506 --> 00:37:09.906
So you're telling me not to come because you're worried about me?

00:37:11.206 --> 00:37:12.206
Of course.

00:37:13.606 --> 00:37:15.046
I know what Mom is like.

00:37:17.306 --> 00:37:20.216
And what do you think she's like?

00:37:23.886 --> 00:37:25.586
She has such high expectations of you.

00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:28.286
And you were tailing her, right?

00:37:30.796 --> 00:37:31.796
All right.

00:37:36.226 --> 00:37:37.296
Hey.

00:37:37.596 --> 00:37:38.866
But aren't you bored out of your mind?

00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:40.536
Do you want me to recommend a webtoon?

00:37:53.716 --> 00:37:54.716
Hold on.

00:37:56.546 --> 00:37:57.556
What is it?

00:38:10.836 --> 00:38:12.096
My mom just walked by.

00:38:36.926 --> 00:38:38.426
Did you know Eun Oh postponed her admission?

00:38:39.026 --> 00:38:40.156
Did you hear from her?

00:38:41.026 --> 00:38:43.896
She said she had some work to do and would check in before dinner.

00:38:44.296 --> 00:38:47.136
And you believed her? What if she's changed her mind?

00:38:49.806 --> 00:38:52.376
Eun Oh will be here. Don't worry. You can go.

00:38:55.546 --> 00:38:57.406
I'm not leaving until I see her admitted.

00:38:59.276 --> 00:39:00.446
I'm telling you. She's coming.

00:39:01.216 --> 00:39:02.786
Call her right now. Put it on speaker.

00:39:06.256 --> 00:39:07.656
What are you doing? Call her.

00:39:08.056 --> 00:39:09.056
I'm reading a webtoon.

00:39:10.926 --> 00:39:11.926
So, let me get this straight.

00:39:12.396 --> 00:39:14.666
You guarantee Eun Oh will show up. Is that it?

00:39:17.096 --> 00:39:18.636
Hey, great work today.

00:39:19.096 --> 00:39:22.636
You need to get some rest, so I'll give you a ride.

00:39:23.336 --> 00:39:25.136
Aren't you having lunch?

00:39:25.506 --> 00:39:28.406
My treat. I still owe you that meal, remember?

00:39:29.106 --> 00:39:31.176
If you pull it off, I'll buy you a meal.

00:39:32.046 --> 00:39:33.046
That's a promise.

00:39:34.216 --> 00:39:35.886
You wouldn't even eat with me when I asked.

00:39:36.816 --> 00:39:39.356
Why treat me before surgery? You're making me nervous.

00:39:41.656 --> 00:39:42.956
After your surgery is over,

00:39:44.696 --> 00:39:46.956
you can treat me then. You have to.

00:39:47.866 --> 00:39:50.096
She's worried something will happen during the surgery.

00:39:50.366 --> 00:39:52.296
It's like she's trying to keep one last promise.

00:39:55.466 --> 00:39:56.466
All right.

00:39:57.676 --> 00:39:59.906
Everyone's waiting for you. I'll get going.

00:40:00.206 --> 00:40:01.206
Su Jeong.

00:40:01.776 --> 00:40:03.276
No, let me take you to the hospital.

00:40:03.846 --> 00:40:06.816
It's a straight shot on the subway. And my stuff is in a locker.

00:40:13.716 --> 00:40:14.726
You can't go to the hospital.

00:40:16.186 --> 00:40:17.186
You can't have the surgery.

00:40:19.856 --> 00:40:21.826
I wish I could take Eun Oh and just run away.

00:40:23.666 --> 00:40:24.666
Mr. Lee.

00:40:25.466 --> 00:40:26.466
Mr. Lee.

00:40:28.106 --> 00:40:30.606
You have a video conference with the managing director at 2pm.

00:40:32.236 --> 00:40:33.276
That's right.

00:40:34.776 --> 00:40:35.776
Okay.

00:40:44.786 --> 00:40:47.386
Please put on a gown and come out. We'll do some basic bloodwork.

00:40:47.456 --> 00:40:48.826
Then you'll consult with the anaesthesiologist.

00:40:49.156 --> 00:40:50.156
Okay.

00:40:52.896 --> 00:40:54.826
Yes, I understand.

00:40:58.766 --> 00:40:59.996
Eun Oh just checked in.

00:41:03.366 --> 00:41:04.376
Just go.

00:41:05.036 --> 00:41:06.136
And don't bother coming tomorrow.

00:41:12.116 --> 00:41:13.116
Woo Jin.

00:41:14.786 --> 00:41:16.146
After the surgery,

00:41:16.846 --> 00:41:19.416
I'll explain everything in detail.

00:41:20.786 --> 00:41:21.956
Once you hear me out,

00:41:22.486 --> 00:41:24.156
you'll understand.

00:41:25.756 --> 00:41:26.756
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:41:28.726 --> 00:41:30.366
I'd rather you didn't come.

00:41:49.386 --> 00:41:50.646
Woo Jin, I'm here.

00:41:53.086 --> 00:41:54.356
Of course. You're a tough one, Ji Eun Oh.

00:41:54.726 --> 00:41:55.786
I know, right?

00:41:56.186 --> 00:41:59.196
They say twins are connected, so how did you end up such a mess?

00:42:01.066 --> 00:42:02.426
Maybe you can learn a thing or two from me.

00:42:03.066 --> 00:42:04.066
I guess I should.

00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:08.066
Then,

00:42:08.566 --> 00:42:09.636
let's do our best tomorrow.

00:42:17.916 --> 00:42:18.916
Let's do this.

00:42:38.966 --> 00:42:41.406
I'm so disappointed in Seong Jae.

00:42:42.236 --> 00:42:43.666
Once you get a girlfriend,

00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:46.106
you must cut ties with any past crushes.

00:42:46.306 --> 00:42:47.306
What's his deal?

00:42:47.776 --> 00:42:50.476
Is he just clueless, or is he not over her?

00:42:50.806 --> 00:42:52.016
I don't think that's it.

00:42:52.346 --> 00:42:54.746
If he still had feelings for her, he wouldn't be dating me.

00:42:55.146 --> 00:42:56.186
Then why are you letting it bother you?

00:42:57.956 --> 00:43:01.526
It's not that weird to visit someone after they've had major surgery.

00:43:01.986 --> 00:43:03.956
Seong Jae's a decent guy.

00:43:05.056 --> 00:43:07.196
I know, but...

00:43:08.096 --> 00:43:12.036
it still bothers me. I hate worrying that he isn't fully over her.

00:43:12.296 --> 00:43:14.666
You're getting jealous of someone you've never even met?

00:43:15.206 --> 00:43:16.206
Look,

00:43:16.766 --> 00:43:20.506
that kind of thing is exhausting. I've seen it tear couples apart.

00:43:21.276 --> 00:43:22.276
Come on.

00:43:22.906 --> 00:43:26.046
I wouldn't be with him if he had any feelings left for someone else.

00:43:44.366 --> 00:43:45.366
So cool.

00:43:48.166 --> 00:43:49.166
Somebody, help me.

00:43:49.436 --> 00:43:52.306
Now that it's my turn, my heart's pounding out of my chest.

00:43:56.546 --> 00:43:57.606
Are you ready?

00:43:58.716 --> 00:43:59.716
Yes.

00:44:01.216 --> 00:44:03.586
- Ms. Jo Ok Rye, you're up. - Yes.

00:44:06.186 --> 00:44:07.186
All right.

00:44:11.256 --> 00:44:12.326
I am a model.

00:44:15.066 --> 00:44:16.066
That's my grandma.

00:44:47.456 --> 00:44:49.366
My grandma is so cool.

00:45:59.936 --> 00:46:03.436
- Great job. That was great. - Amazing!

00:46:10.206 --> 00:46:12.476
- Grandma! - Well done!

00:46:13.776 --> 00:46:18.256
Grandma, you were amazing today. You looked like a total pro!

00:46:18.386 --> 00:46:20.616
My heart was about to leap out of my chest.

00:46:20.756 --> 00:46:24.826
Really? Your walk was perfect, and that outfit was made for you.

00:46:25.026 --> 00:46:27.126
You were so charismatic.

00:46:28.096 --> 00:46:31.196
You went through a lot helping me too, didn't you?

00:46:31.396 --> 00:46:33.566
No, I was here filming for my project anyway.

00:46:34.866 --> 00:46:35.866
Let's get a cab, Grandma.

00:46:36.306 --> 00:46:38.476
You've been on your feet all day, so let's take it easy.

00:46:40.336 --> 00:46:41.346
Su Bin.

00:46:42.146 --> 00:46:43.306
Actually,

00:46:43.846 --> 00:46:45.146
let's go home separately today.

00:46:46.076 --> 00:46:47.676
Separately? Why?

00:46:49.716 --> 00:46:53.386
I just feel like it. What? Is that weird?

00:46:55.386 --> 00:46:58.426
No, it's not. You know which bus to take home from here, right?

00:46:58.496 --> 00:47:00.926
Of course. I even did a dry run.

00:47:01.696 --> 00:47:03.196
Okay, I'll see you at home.

00:47:04.636 --> 00:47:05.636
Get home safe.

00:47:09.636 --> 00:47:11.066
Maybe she's just overwhelmed by it all?

00:47:11.736 --> 00:47:12.736
Yes, I think so.

00:47:25.086 --> 00:47:26.386
I'm going to head out.

00:47:34.696 --> 00:47:36.766
How could you let your grandma go home alone?

00:47:37.896 --> 00:47:39.836
I only came here to see you.

00:47:40.366 --> 00:47:42.666
Hey, don't get the wrong idea.

00:47:43.236 --> 00:47:45.136
No matter how much I like you,

00:47:45.436 --> 00:47:47.106
I would never let my grandma go home alone.

00:47:48.576 --> 00:47:50.276
Then why did she leave alone?

00:47:52.346 --> 00:47:53.446
She said she wanted to go alone.

00:47:54.616 --> 00:47:57.046
I guess she wants to savour the moment.

00:47:58.156 --> 00:47:59.816
She's not an ordinary grandma anymore, you know.

00:48:02.856 --> 00:48:04.086
She's a very special grandma.

00:48:05.256 --> 00:48:07.056
I was amazed when I saw her on stage.

00:48:08.626 --> 00:48:09.626
But...

00:48:10.526 --> 00:48:11.696
why are you here?

00:48:14.536 --> 00:48:15.866
If I didn't get to see you today,

00:48:17.306 --> 00:48:18.506
I thought I was going to lose my mind.

00:48:20.536 --> 00:48:21.546
Well...

00:48:22.176 --> 00:48:23.276
I can't say I mind hearing that.

00:48:31.756 --> 00:48:32.856
I like you.

00:48:34.956 --> 00:48:36.326
I like you a lot.

00:48:37.826 --> 00:48:38.956
All I can think about...

00:48:40.226 --> 00:48:41.666
is you.

00:48:45.436 --> 00:48:46.436
So, what's your answer?

00:48:47.096 --> 00:48:48.106
You don't believe me?

00:48:49.366 --> 00:48:51.406
I do, but...

00:48:57.776 --> 00:48:59.646
I'm sorry for making you feel insecure.

00:49:00.576 --> 00:49:01.786
But that friend of mine...

00:49:02.946 --> 00:49:04.346
Actually, it's because of her...

00:49:05.286 --> 00:49:07.686
that I became sure of my feelings for you.

00:49:09.426 --> 00:49:11.696
There's a reason I can't go with you.

00:49:12.126 --> 00:49:13.356
A bunch of us are going together,

00:49:13.956 --> 00:49:15.526
but she's going through some things.

00:49:16.196 --> 00:49:19.436
It's not like I was insisting we go together.

00:49:20.236 --> 00:49:21.236
I know.

00:49:21.766 --> 00:49:23.206
I didn't explain myself well.

00:49:24.736 --> 00:49:27.436
But it's complicated. So please, just be patient with me.

00:49:28.446 --> 00:49:30.976
Once things are settled between your brother, Ji Hyuk, and Eun Oh,

00:49:31.676 --> 00:49:32.676
I'll tell you everything then.

00:49:34.746 --> 00:49:38.086
So is she someone you can introduce me to someday?

00:49:39.456 --> 00:49:40.456
Of course.

00:49:41.186 --> 00:49:42.786
And about...

00:49:43.756 --> 00:49:44.996
the crush I mentioned.

00:49:45.696 --> 00:49:47.526
That wasn't love.

00:49:48.596 --> 00:49:49.766
I realise that now that I've met you.

00:49:58.206 --> 00:49:59.206
I'm sorry.

00:50:00.206 --> 00:50:01.306
I jumped to conclusions.

00:50:07.016 --> 00:50:08.186
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

00:50:09.386 --> 00:50:10.616
For causing the misunderstanding.

00:50:35.506 --> 00:50:37.776
Is that Jo Ok Rye?

00:50:39.376 --> 00:50:43.016
The Jo Ok Rye who reeked of fish from her husband's anchovy boat?

00:50:45.516 --> 00:50:49.256
The one who used to gut fish at the market?

00:50:53.596 --> 00:50:54.596
The same Jo Ok Rye who used to...

00:50:54.926 --> 00:50:58.766
clean her husband's bedpan at the hospital?

00:50:59.896 --> 00:51:03.106
The Jo Ok Rye whose heart was breaking...

00:51:03.336 --> 00:51:05.776
when Sang Cheol couldn't find a new job?

00:51:07.206 --> 00:51:09.246
The one who felt sorry for her daughter-in-law...

00:51:09.576 --> 00:51:13.816
and felt like a burden to everyone, not knowing when she might pass?

00:51:18.356 --> 00:51:20.286
Not anymore.

00:51:21.186 --> 00:51:22.286
Now...

00:51:23.426 --> 00:51:24.926
I'm just Jo Ok Rye.

00:51:28.426 --> 00:51:30.966
Jo Ok Rye, the senior model.

00:51:33.596 --> 00:51:38.066
One, two, three, four, five.

00:51:38.736 --> 00:51:39.736
And pose.

00:51:39.836 --> 00:51:43.846
One, two, three, four, five.

00:51:45.746 --> 00:51:46.746
Mom.

00:51:47.646 --> 00:51:48.716
Dad.

00:51:50.316 --> 00:51:52.956
Your Ok Rye became a model.

00:51:54.286 --> 00:51:58.186
I bet you'd come back to life just to see for yourselves.

00:52:21.146 --> 00:52:22.246
Seong Jae.

00:52:45.976 --> 00:52:49.946
I guess she took the bus. I wonder why she didn't take a cab.

00:52:52.776 --> 00:52:54.546
She was trying to save money on the fare.

00:52:54.846 --> 00:52:55.946
The cab fare?

00:52:58.046 --> 00:52:59.886
But she must be exhausted today.

00:53:00.716 --> 00:53:02.286
I guess all moms are the same.

00:53:02.956 --> 00:53:06.856
My grandma saw my dad wearing all those pain patches...

00:53:06.926 --> 00:53:09.966
and said she'd save money to buy a mat from Mom's store.

00:53:10.926 --> 00:53:12.836
- What kind of mat? - Not sure.

00:53:12.936 --> 00:53:15.566
Grandma has tried it. She just said it was amazing.

00:53:20.906 --> 00:53:22.076
Grandma...

00:53:22.906 --> 00:53:24.406
is a mom, too.

00:53:33.586 --> 00:53:35.526
Is no one home yet?

00:53:37.986 --> 00:53:40.856
- Congratulations, Grandma! - Congratulations! Here you go.

00:53:40.956 --> 00:53:41.996
Gosh, you scared me!

00:53:42.326 --> 00:53:44.266
- Let's light the candles. - What in the world is all this?

00:53:45.136 --> 00:53:47.536
- Here. - Make a wish and blow it out.

00:53:47.796 --> 00:53:49.066
Right.

00:53:50.906 --> 00:53:53.906
- Yes! - Congratulations.

00:53:54.606 --> 00:53:55.746
Thank you, everyone.

00:53:56.706 --> 00:53:58.146
This is just wonderful.

00:53:59.746 --> 00:54:00.846
Mother, is that really you?

00:54:01.276 --> 00:54:02.586
You look like a completely different person.

00:54:02.816 --> 00:54:05.616
Wow, who knew my mother had this side to her?

00:54:07.056 --> 00:54:08.356
What's all that supposed to mean?

00:54:08.726 --> 00:54:10.726
It means you're awesome, Grandma!

00:54:10.926 --> 00:54:12.996
Grandma, is it even legal for you to look this cool?

00:54:14.156 --> 00:54:17.926
This is just from the clips of you that Ha Eun rushed to edit.

00:54:18.026 --> 00:54:21.436
- In the cut, Grandma was the star. - Oh, my.

00:54:21.436 --> 00:54:23.266
Her stage presence was on another level.

00:54:23.936 --> 00:54:25.736
It was the strangest thing.

00:54:26.136 --> 00:54:28.846
Backstage, I was shaking like a leaf,

00:54:29.346 --> 00:54:31.606
but the second that spotlight hit me,

00:54:32.076 --> 00:54:35.216
- my feet glided by themselves. - My goodness.

00:54:35.716 --> 00:54:38.316
Turns out you're a natural on stage, Mother.

00:54:38.916 --> 00:54:40.756
That makeup and that outfit...

00:54:41.116 --> 00:54:43.556
I'm over 60, and I've never seen you like that before.

00:54:43.626 --> 00:54:46.696
Grandma, can our whole family come to your next fashion show?

00:54:48.026 --> 00:54:52.266
Really? Well, I suppose you could all come now.

00:54:52.336 --> 00:54:53.366
You should come.

00:54:56.036 --> 00:54:57.236
Seriously, Grandma, you're the best.

00:55:04.346 --> 00:55:05.676
Listen, Da Jeong.

00:55:06.416 --> 00:55:07.546
Yes, Mother?

00:55:08.646 --> 00:55:11.086
Today, I...

00:55:11.956 --> 00:55:13.316
I got my modelling fee.

00:55:14.156 --> 00:55:15.326
But it's...

00:55:15.726 --> 00:55:16.926
Did you lose it?

00:55:17.386 --> 00:55:19.426
No, nothing like that.

00:55:20.096 --> 00:55:21.826
It's the very first money...

00:55:22.266 --> 00:55:24.566
I've ever earned from having a proper job.

00:55:24.926 --> 00:55:27.636
And I know it's only right to give it to you,

00:55:29.366 --> 00:55:30.736
but I want to give it to my son.

00:55:31.506 --> 00:55:32.506
Mother.

00:55:32.906 --> 00:55:35.546
It's your money. Why give it to either of us?

00:55:35.906 --> 00:55:37.446
You should spend it on yourself.

00:55:37.946 --> 00:55:39.546
It's my first paycheck,

00:55:41.046 --> 00:55:42.986
and I just want to give it to him.

00:55:45.856 --> 00:55:47.216
Fine. But you have to give me...

00:55:47.216 --> 00:55:49.656
your second paycheck, every last cent.

00:55:50.586 --> 00:55:51.756
Of course.

00:55:52.026 --> 00:55:54.626
I was already planning on it. Absolutely.

00:55:55.766 --> 00:55:58.796
Go on. Talk to your son.

00:56:00.966 --> 00:56:02.306
Here, take this.

00:56:03.936 --> 00:56:05.236
What is this?

00:56:05.506 --> 00:56:08.106
When your mother tells you to take something, you take it.

00:56:08.546 --> 00:56:09.646
Hurry.

00:56:10.576 --> 00:56:11.776
Okay.

00:56:13.646 --> 00:56:14.846
That is...

00:56:15.616 --> 00:56:16.986
the first money I've ever...

00:56:17.316 --> 00:56:21.956
It's the first money I've earned from a real job.

00:56:22.826 --> 00:56:24.726
But I'm just a beginner,

00:56:25.356 --> 00:56:27.826
so the modelling fee wasn't much.

00:56:28.296 --> 00:56:30.966
And after taxes and all that, well...

00:56:31.726 --> 00:56:33.236
There's probably some loose change in there.

00:56:34.696 --> 00:56:36.566
But why are you giving this to me?

00:56:39.436 --> 00:56:42.506
You've fed me for over 20 years...

00:56:43.806 --> 00:56:45.776
and paid for your father's hospital bills.

00:56:47.046 --> 00:56:48.476
I've been so grateful.

00:56:48.986 --> 00:56:51.886
That's why I wanted to give you...

00:56:53.116 --> 00:56:54.316
my very first paycheck.

00:56:59.056 --> 00:57:00.396
Mother.

00:57:01.926 --> 00:57:04.766
I guess I did a pretty decent job today.

00:57:04.766 --> 00:57:08.806
They've already scheduled my next gig.

00:57:09.136 --> 00:57:12.636
But I promised my next paycheck to your wife.

00:57:14.306 --> 00:57:15.406
Right.

00:57:15.746 --> 00:57:17.776
All right. I'll take it.

00:57:18.376 --> 00:57:19.516
Thank you.

00:57:20.546 --> 00:57:22.016
Wow, this is hefty.

00:57:22.486 --> 00:57:24.016
Come on.

00:57:24.516 --> 00:57:26.586
You're embarrassing me.

00:57:27.856 --> 00:57:30.956
Gosh, I never thought...

00:57:31.026 --> 00:57:33.426
I'd be getting an allowance from my mom in my 60s.

00:57:36.526 --> 00:57:37.666
Sang Cheol.

00:57:40.066 --> 00:57:41.266
Don't...

00:57:42.006 --> 00:57:43.836
work yourself to the bone like this.

00:57:46.176 --> 00:57:47.606
For 33 years,

00:57:49.046 --> 00:57:50.446
you've been the man of the house.

00:57:52.476 --> 00:57:54.116
Because of your useless parents,

00:57:54.876 --> 00:57:57.216
you had to break your back for us.

00:57:59.956 --> 00:58:01.216
These days, well...

00:58:02.526 --> 00:58:04.426
I hear there's something called a reverse mortgage.

00:58:05.626 --> 00:58:09.596
With our current mortgage, how much would we even get?

00:58:10.896 --> 00:58:13.336
We still have a long way to go, don't we?

00:58:15.506 --> 00:58:16.666
I suppose that's true.

00:58:18.706 --> 00:58:20.306
I myself never dreamed...

00:58:21.776 --> 00:58:23.906
I'd live long enough...

00:58:24.476 --> 00:58:25.976
to see 90.

00:58:28.216 --> 00:58:29.516
If only your father...

00:58:30.246 --> 00:58:33.916
hadn't been constantly in and out of the hospital,

00:58:34.986 --> 00:58:38.726
I would have gone out and gotten a job long ago.

00:58:42.496 --> 00:58:44.396
I never thought I'd spend so many years...

00:58:46.066 --> 00:58:48.336
just being a burden.

00:58:49.406 --> 00:58:50.506
To be honest,

00:58:51.106 --> 00:58:53.276
I'm scared too.

00:58:54.576 --> 00:58:59.176
I can get by doing odd jobs, even if it's not a proper career.

00:58:59.176 --> 00:59:00.446
But...

00:59:01.016 --> 00:59:03.486
what if I have to live like that for too long?

00:59:04.646 --> 00:59:05.856
That's why...

00:59:06.156 --> 00:59:09.086
I'm trying to find a stable job, Mother.

00:59:12.526 --> 00:59:15.126
But we still have Ji Hyuk.

00:59:16.666 --> 00:59:19.196
He's the CEO of a big company now.

00:59:20.036 --> 00:59:22.966
That company is built on investor debt.

00:59:22.966 --> 00:59:25.836
So deep down, I'm always on edge about it.

00:59:26.136 --> 00:59:28.076
I'm just praying he'll be okay.

00:59:29.206 --> 00:59:31.976
But even if Ji Hyuk does get on his feet,

00:59:32.476 --> 00:59:35.486
I don't want to live off of an allowance from him.

00:59:38.686 --> 00:59:39.786
Right.

00:59:41.216 --> 00:59:42.726
Of course, I know.

00:59:45.056 --> 00:59:46.156
That day...

00:59:46.426 --> 00:59:48.866
I saw you when it was just the two of us.

00:59:55.466 --> 00:59:56.806
I'm sorry, Mother.

00:59:57.866 --> 00:59:59.906
What do you have to be sorry for?

01:00:02.576 --> 01:00:06.276
I'm the one who should be sorry. You're...

01:00:06.846 --> 01:00:09.286
You've been walking with a long face every day,

01:00:10.046 --> 01:00:11.386
and yet I'm the one...

01:00:12.086 --> 01:00:13.416
who's been on cloud nine lately.

01:00:15.456 --> 01:00:16.926
Gosh, Mother.

01:00:17.226 --> 01:00:20.596
I wonder what cloud nine is like when you're almost 90.

01:00:29.806 --> 01:00:30.936
I hope my son...

01:00:32.876 --> 01:00:35.906
gets to feel this way until he's 90, too.

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:58.396
"To our valued customers. Due to a family member's surgery,"

01:00:58.466 --> 01:01:00.636
"we will be closing early today."

01:01:01.896 --> 01:01:03.406
Nice touch, Gang Oh.

01:01:03.706 --> 01:01:05.536
- Does it look okay? - Yes.

01:01:11.106 --> 01:01:13.446
(Cheong Ah University Hospital)

01:01:15.986 --> 01:01:19.116
Mom, why'd you give her pigtails? That's so not her style.

01:01:19.656 --> 01:01:22.356
I haven't done your hair since you finished elementary school.

01:01:23.326 --> 01:01:24.956
It's a shame it has to be for a surgery.

01:01:26.296 --> 01:01:27.956
Maybe I should ask you to do it once a month then?

01:01:30.396 --> 01:01:32.296
That means you plan on making it out of there alive.

01:01:32.866 --> 01:01:36.206
Of course. Have you seen anyone here who's healthier than me?

01:01:36.266 --> 01:01:39.636
Right. I couldn't even sleep, and you were sleeping like a rock?

01:01:39.636 --> 01:01:42.276
I saw you when I used the bathroom. You were drooling.

01:01:42.346 --> 01:01:43.976
I was not drooling!

01:01:44.676 --> 01:01:47.946
Gang Oh, you came to talk nonsense, didn't you?

01:01:48.276 --> 01:01:52.156
You think I'd miss my one chance to see you at your ugliest moment?

01:01:52.586 --> 01:01:55.456
- I'll take pictures. - Gosh, Gang Oh, you're impossible.

01:01:56.586 --> 01:01:59.126
I thought we'd be sending her off to the OR in tears,

01:01:59.556 --> 01:02:00.896
but it looks like we'll send her off smiling.

01:02:02.566 --> 01:02:05.636
By the way, some guy has been pacing back and forth in the hall.

01:02:05.736 --> 01:02:06.836
What?

01:02:12.736 --> 01:02:13.736
What?

01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:18.916
Hello.

01:02:19.646 --> 01:02:23.816
- I work with Eun Oh. - Oh, I see.

01:02:25.316 --> 01:02:27.756
Shouldn't you be at work? What are you doing here?

01:02:28.156 --> 01:02:30.556
Eun Oh and I are business partners now.

01:02:31.126 --> 01:02:33.926
I think we've met a few times when I've dropped her off.

01:02:34.296 --> 01:02:37.166
Right. Yes, that's right. I remember you now.

01:02:37.696 --> 01:02:38.936
Look at him, acting all innocent.

01:02:41.536 --> 01:02:42.536
Gang Oh.

01:02:44.606 --> 01:02:45.606
It's been a while.

01:02:48.036 --> 01:02:49.876
Did you get any sleep?

01:02:51.606 --> 01:02:52.916
I feel great.

01:02:54.316 --> 01:02:55.376
About the surgery...

01:02:55.686 --> 01:02:57.446
I never got the chance to wish you good luck on the surgery.

01:02:59.116 --> 01:03:00.316
Hey, that guy...

01:03:00.916 --> 01:03:04.356
Isn't he the senior from school Eun Oh used to have a crush on?

01:03:04.956 --> 01:03:05.956
That's him.

01:03:07.726 --> 01:03:11.726
- I have to go to the OR now. - Right.

01:03:12.236 --> 01:03:13.336
Your surgery...

01:03:14.036 --> 01:03:15.036
I hope it goes well.

01:03:17.206 --> 01:03:18.206
Thanks.

01:03:19.006 --> 01:03:21.106
To think I'll get to see you healthy again,

01:03:22.206 --> 01:03:23.376
it feels like a dream.

01:03:26.376 --> 01:03:29.616
You're going to get updates. Did you really need to come?

01:03:31.446 --> 01:03:33.616
I'm your mother. That makes me your guardian.

01:03:35.826 --> 01:03:36.956
Besides,

01:03:37.086 --> 01:03:40.456
I was the one who wanted to save you the most.

01:03:41.626 --> 01:03:43.366
Do you want to deny that too?

01:03:49.536 --> 01:03:52.276
Just go to sleep, it'll all be over when you wake up, Woo Jin.

01:03:58.106 --> 01:04:01.646
Mr. Han, you're the recipient today of a liver transplant.

01:04:01.716 --> 01:04:06.556
The surgery will take eight hours, and you'll get a partial liver.

01:04:06.916 --> 01:04:09.856
You'll be moved to the ICU immediately after surgery.

01:04:45.696 --> 01:04:46.926
You've got this, Woo Jin.

01:05:42.016 --> 01:05:44.186
(Our Golden Days)

01:05:44.586 --> 01:05:47.016
The surgery went well, didn't it? Is Eun Oh okay?

01:05:47.156 --> 01:05:49.486
Who is he doing that for?

01:05:49.726 --> 01:05:52.996
I'm sorry I only ever yelled at you for not living your own life.

01:05:53.556 --> 01:05:55.256
You're just like Dokgo Chan.

01:05:55.826 --> 01:05:58.566
- Because I'm pretty. - My goodness.

01:05:58.866 --> 01:06:00.136
You're dating?

01:06:00.366 --> 01:06:03.036
I've been working on a webtoon this whole time.

01:06:03.206 --> 01:06:06.236
- Is Mr. Lee okay? - Mom, don't tell me you...

01:06:06.706 --> 01:06:09.076
If only things could always be...

01:06:09.846 --> 01:06:11.546
exactly like they are today.

01:06:12.206 --> 01:06:13.216
A car accident?
