[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.900
[Episode 31]

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.000
My dear nephew.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.830
Everyone already thinks

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.900
I've made a fortune here.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.450
If I go and personally decide

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.560
to hand over the Lianghuai salt industry

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.840
to your family,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.460
the memorials impeaching me

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.140
would pile up even higher than
the city wall.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.229
However, if you render some merit,

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.350
then others won't have anything
to hold against you.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.280
Don't you agree?

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.910
Am I right?

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.810
That's one way to look at it.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.120
But why did you involve

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.280
Gu Pingyuan in this?

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.720
What if he wins?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.820
What then?

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.560
Mr. Gu represents

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.710
the small merchants
among the common people.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.200
If Mr. Gu wins,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.840
then the salt industry in Jiangnan

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.030
can no longer be dictated solely

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.360
by your Li family.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.370
You'll have to leave some room

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.730
for the merchants of Jiangnan to survive.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.700
If your family takes everything,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.060
it wouldn't look good for me

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.360
as the Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.020
to do nothing about it, right?

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.240
Sir, I have one more matter.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.680
If this coastal embankment

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.540
were to be funded by our Li family,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.470
all expenses

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.110
would naturally be covered entirely by us.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.520
But how should Mr. Gu's share

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.850
of the costs be handled?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.120
Of course we'll wait for
the imperial court's approval.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.000
Court approval? I'm afraid that
even if we wait until next year

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.430
when the floods come again,
the funds still won't be released.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.960
I understand what you mean, Sir.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.130
I dare not delay.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.710
I'll go to Nantong right away

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.400
to inspect the damage to
the coastal embankment

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.260
and make a plan.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.290
I take my leave.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.110
Please proceed, my dear nephew.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.620
I'll thank you in advance

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.610
on behalf of the people of Nantong.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.190
Mr. Gu,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.360
did I say you could leave?

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.079
But I need to go to Nantong
for the field inspection.

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.270
Don't make excuses.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.870
The moment you two walk out of this door,

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.150
you'll definitely start calling me names.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.079
Come on, inside.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.560
I'll give you the money for
the coastal embankment repairs.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.870
I've already mortgaged

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.530
all my properties in Beijing.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.800
We may not be as rich as the Li family,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.910
but you must remember:

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.000
the money you're receiving is clean,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.120
and you must make sure
its use is clean as well.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.520
This...

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.910
Li Qin is right.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.750
Even when it floods again next year,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.410
the imperial court's money
still won't arrive.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.000
But the common people
can't wait that long.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.310
I won't let you down, Sir.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.830
Remember this

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.150
about me:

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.520
I've been simple-minded my whole life,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.310
and my learning and literacy
have never matched others.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.520
But there's one thing—

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.280
I take one step at a time,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.840
neither deceiving myself

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.590
nor others,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.680
and once I set out to do something,
I see it through.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.000
If you rush and push for progress,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.800
it will only lead to grave mistakes.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.120
Are you inspecting the coastal embankment
or racing horses?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.190
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.040
That old man is now

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.040
treating us like three-year-olds.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.070
He's already started

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.130
sowing discord between us in public.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.000
Here's what I thought.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.040
After I left just now,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.870
he definitely started muttering about me
behind my back again, right?

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.920
Didn't you ask him for me

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.830
why he wouldn't help me

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.120
with the salt field matter?

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.720
I did.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.630
He said your family

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.270
was just taking advantage of
others' misfortune.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.390
Taking advantage of others' misfortune?

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.030
Nonsense.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.800
Merchants buy low and sell high.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.580
This has been

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.630
the natural order of things
since ancient times.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.070
If I preach morality to them every day,

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.870
I'll be left with nothing to eat.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.140
Let's go check the coastal embankment.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.070
This matter is quite troublesome.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.560
Gu,

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.460
give me your word first

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.590
so I can feel at ease.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.480
Go ahead.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.310
My father asked me to handle

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.360
the salt field matter in Lianghuai.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.470
This is my only chance

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.800
to make something of myself.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.060
So I've been thinking,

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.560
no matter what it costs,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.850
I have to win

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and get this done.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.050
Could you give me some leeway?

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.310
It's not a matter of giving you leeway.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.920
Well,

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.390
I've never done
any salt field business before, either.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.380
But as you said,

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.030
we're not three-year-olds.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.870
He wants to trap us

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.950
in a chicken coop,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.830
but we

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.000
can't just let him manipulate us,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.480
right?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.580
Then let's settle it this way:

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.840
for the height of the coastal embankment,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.240
give me some concession.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.600
The imperial court's standard

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.360
is 11 meters.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.510
I'll raise it by

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.360
an extra 3.3 meters on top of that.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.380
Is that acceptable?

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.600
I'll thank you in advance

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.800
on behalf of the people of Nantong then.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.830
I am Gu Pingyuan.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.660
I am Li Qin, candidate intendant
of Jiangning.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.800
[Marshal]

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.560
Come on in.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.150
[Marshal]

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.480
Marshal Jiu.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.730
Marshal Jiu.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.750
Whenever it's time to pay the troops,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.720
I get anxious.

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.830
You two

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.090
seem to have much free time.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.159
Marshal Jiu.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.190
The Viceroy of Liangjiang has tasked us

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.000
with repairing the coastal embankment
in Nantong,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.800
but now Nantong is nearly deserted.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.480
We can't even gather enough workers,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.360
so we've come specifically to trouble you,
Marshal Jiu,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.160
hoping to borrow some manpower.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.390
Well, we won't be using your soldiers

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.120
for free.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.750
Stonemasons and carpenters
will be paid

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.960
300 maces per day,

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.160
and laborers 150 per day.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.460
Paid daily for work completed,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.950
with meals and lodging
provided on-site.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.660
Borrow soldiers?

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.070
Come on, just take them away.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.400
Take as many as you need.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.900
That's excellent!

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.560
I've been worried about

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.960
owing my soldiers' pay
for over half a year.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.750
They've been grumbling every day,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.659
on the verge of mutiny against me.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.480
If you can take them off my hands,

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.250
I'll thank you both eternally.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.360
Please.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.560
That's not what His Excellency said.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.950
He told us that
if we ran into manpower problems,

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.150
we should come to you.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.170
I'm in urgent need of money now

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.670
so I can dismiss them quickly

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.920
before they cause trouble here.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.820
Do you still dare to take them?

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.120
But...

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.360
Sir.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.390
Then what do you suggest we do?

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.610
This isn't something money can solve.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.750
If once the work starts,

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.720
the schedule is delayed

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.070
due to a shortage of manpower,

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.310
-then how should we...
-Getting impatient?

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.120
Don't be.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.290
That old man sent you to see me—

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.840
of course I have a solution.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.250
I knew

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.360
Marshal Jiu must have a brilliant plan.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.430
to remain silent
before those who can respond

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.890
is a mistake of judgment."

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.750
Your Excellency,

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.630
which mistake do you plan to make?

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.030
You, oh you.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.790
Li Million,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.950
you're still the same as always.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:27.270
Alright then.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.910
Let's be frank and open with each other.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.960
All the revenue
from the Lianghuai salt fields

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.670
has been going to your Li family,

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.930
leaving the Jiangnan region lifeless.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.530
At the very least, show some mercy

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.850
and leave a little for the local area.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.550
The money made in Lianghuai
should be used in Lianghuai.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:45.550
Your Excellency,

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.840
please do not interfere.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.220
Before leaving the capital,

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.970
His Highness instructed me

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.910
that as long as you can ensure this area

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.730
remains peaceful for 3 years,

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.320
he'll find a way

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.350
to get you to the capital
to enjoy a life of ease.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.140
Don't get involved

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.300
in the salt field matter anymore.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.720
Eat slowly.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.190
Don't bite your fingers.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.890
Look at you,

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.870
so busy every day.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.030
We barely even see you.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.200
You don't know the whole story.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.640
The coastal embankment in Nantong

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.750
has been washed away,

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.750
and the entire land

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.070
has been flooded by seawater.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.890
The common people are fleeing everywhere

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.020
with nothing to eat.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.200
When we first heard

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.710
you were going to Nantong,

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.920
Yu'er and I were actually happy about it.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.050
Who would have imagined such a big city

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.330
would end up in such a terrible state?

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.350
When the major construction starts,

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.310
I'll take you both

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.760
to Nantong for a trip.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.440
We'll also visit nearby places

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.110
like Zhenjiang

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.160
and Jinshan Temple.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.360
Don't worry, Mother.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.800
You want to go on a trip that much?

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.560
I came all the way here with you—

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.830
was it just to sit in a different place?

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:36.690
Sorry for that.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.670
Pingyuan.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.530
Mr. Su from Nantong is here.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.200
Mr. Su.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.440
-I pay my respects to you, Mr. Gu.
-Mr. Su! Mr. Su.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.240
Please get up.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.200
If there's anything, you could have
just sent someone to inform me.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.000
Why did you come

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.880
all this way in person?

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.110
This is only right.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.100
Well, Pingwen,

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.200
hurry and clean up these dishes.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.000
Make some good tea

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.160
and prepare some fruit

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.070
for Mr. Su.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.280
Mr. Su,

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.510
please wait a second.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.640
I'll go get changed.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.440
Mr. Su.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.160
Apples.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.640
Tea.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.550
Thank you.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.200
I'll put it here.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.460
Please have a rest.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.500
Let me help you.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:50.840
Pingyuan.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.340
Six apples,

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.920
eaten in one go.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.290
Go get some more snacks.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.200
Sorry to keep you waiting,

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:08.830
Mr. Su.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.680
I've traveled hundreds of miles

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.490
and am utterly exhausted.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.880
Please forgive me, Sir.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.750
Please don't call me that.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.410
I don't deserve such respect.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.110
But it's not that far

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.510
from Nantong to Jiangning.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.110
How could you have traveled
hundreds of miles?

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.640
I've been running around
borrowing grain everywhere.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.680
This year, life in Nantong

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.030
has truly become unbearable.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:37.630
I understand.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.510
This year has indeed been
full of disasters.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.720
But since I've agreed

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.070
to repair the coastal embankment,

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.590
I'll definitely provide Nantong

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.920
with a proper solution.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.080
Pardon me for my incompetence,

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.910
but there's one matter
I can only ask of you.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.880
Please, sit down.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.550
Sorry for embarrassing myself.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.590
The reason I came here

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.150
is mainly to ask you, Mr. Gu,

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.440
to submit a petition for me.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.440
Nantong has always been prosperous
since ancient times.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.500
If not for this flood

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.440
and the collapsed coastal embankment,

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.550
we wouldn't be suffering like this.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.110
Many people in Nantong

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.260
have started selling their children.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.760
I understand.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.480
So Mr. Su, what do you

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.170
specifically plan to do next?

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.370
Right now,

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.060
in this small city of Nantong,

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.000
grain merchants from 5 provinces
have all gathered,

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.960
and the rice price is extremely high.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.880
What I'm thinking is that

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.280
I hope the Viceroy
can send some troops here

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.590
to post a notice,

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.130
prohibiting the merchants from
hoarding grain.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.000
Mr. Su,

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.400
I'm not an official.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.750
But when it comes to business,

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.000
I'm not totally an amateur.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.670
You want the Viceroy

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.160
to send troops to post a notice.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:55.960
For one thing,

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.760
the Viceroy might not agree;

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.280
for another,

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.200
those rice merchants

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.800
might just pack up and leave.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.440
The rice belongs to them,

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.400
so they can set the price

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.440
however they like.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.900
We have no control over it.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.240
I'm about to be

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.070
driven to death by those people.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.440
Those rice merchants

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.450
are all extremely wealthy.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:18.160
As a mere county magistrate,

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.810
I really can't afford to offend them.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.980
How about this, Mr. Su?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.070
Stay here

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:24.930
for the night.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.510
First thing tomorrow morning,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.640
I'll go deliver this petition for you.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.680
And I'll talk to those grain merchants

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.310
from the 5 provinces while I'm at it.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.880
Okay.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.790
Pingwen.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.020
Are the snacks ready?

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.020
Yes, Gu.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.960
I've made a pot of plain noodles,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.220
sliced two cucumbers,

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.800
and shredded a salted duck.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.750
I wonder if this suits

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.790
your taste, Mr. Su?

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.210
O-Of course.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:46.960
It suits perfectly.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.620
Mr. Su.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.280
Please.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.790
Okay.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.230
One really can't go without eating, right?

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.090
Indeed.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.100
I heard the people in Nantong

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.890
have started selling their children?

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:12.510
Yes.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:16.280
Let's go.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.310
Take me there.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.330
For what?

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.480
You want to draw your sword
and kill some of them?

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.440
So you won't do anything about
those people?

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.840
What a corrupt official.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.640
Could you not scold me right away?

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.830
I'm not even an official—

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:27.920
how could I be a corrupt one?

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.780
If you're not a corrupt official,

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.360
then you're a profiteer.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.150
If you want to talk about profiteers,

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.720
those bastards are the real profiteers.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.830
They know clearly
that the people in Nantong

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:35.750
are starving to death,

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.200
yet they're still hoarding goods there

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.600
without any compassion.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.440
Tonight,

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.490
let me, the corrupt official,

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.380
think about

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.910
how to punish those profiteers carefully.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:55.560
I'm so tired.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.300
Take a look at this.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:14.920
To be fair,

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.150
this Su Yuhua is a good official.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.680
He's an old provincial candidate.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.590
After all these years,

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.920

yet he wouldn't appreciate it.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.200
I never feel any burden about

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.200
taking money from someone like him.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:46.440
When dealing with him,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.590
you have to strip him clean
down to the last hair.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:49.590
What's your plan?

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.110
How much do you plan to make from him?

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.000
As much as possible, of course.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.070
I'm thinking,

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.350
since his name is Yang Ten-Million,

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.080
let's make 10 million from him.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.030
I'll go to Jinling to buy rice first.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.720
And you'll go to Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui,

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.590
making a trip around the whole area.

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.480
Flaunt yourself in public every day,

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.440
saying that rice in Nantong is expensive,

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.900
and you, Li Million's son,

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.350
have been sent
by the Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.280
to collect rice.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:12.720
But

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.400
don't buy a single grain.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.550
How much money

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.400
can you put together right now?

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.600
Let's pool our money.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.070
About a million taels.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.000
Is that enough?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.860
That's enough.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.830
This pearl

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.850
belongs to

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.490
Li Million's prodigal son.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.110
He made a bet with me

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.030
that within 10 days,

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:32.200
the rice price would definitely drop.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.880
This was his stake.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.120
As long as

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.400
we don't sell even a single dan of rice,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.330
how could the price possibly drop?

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.890
Within 10 days,

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.680
if even a single grain of rice

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.830
appears in Nantong,

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.030
we'll buy it all up.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.300
Let's see how he'll force us
to lower the price.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.500
That's what we'll do.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.100
We'll let all merchants in the world

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.770
know that Li Million

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.340
was defeated in Nantong,

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.690
defeated by me,

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.750
defeated by all of us!

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.150
Mr. Chang,

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.489
once you dress up like this,

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.790
you look exactly like

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.050
a big merchant.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.690
Does it work?

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:19.230
Yes.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.590
That's not right.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.190
There should be glasses too.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.679
Right, glasses too.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.320
Here.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.710
Nice.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.270
I'm Chang Si,

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.000
from Shanxi.

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:42.190
I've been in the rice and flour business
in Guangdong and Guangxi for years.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.980
I'm grateful to you for all your support
over the years.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.510
As this is my first time
visiting your esteemed place,

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.000
I hope I haven't caused too much trouble.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:48.920
Much obliged.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:50.230
Mr. Chang,

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.940
as expected from an old hand.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.110
You look the part perfectly.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.850
Well, you haven't seen me yet.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.650
Mr. Liao, don't rush.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.630
After Mr. Chang finishes his show
tomorrow,

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.690
it will be your turn to take the stage.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.150
-Be careful.
-Ladies and gentlemen,

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.980
watch me.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.000
This plaster

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.150
wasn't my idea.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.510
Pingwen.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.400
What's this about?

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.020
I'm your henchman,

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.060
serving as your butler.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.590
Alright, alright.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:19.960
That's enough.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.760
Get up. Get up.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.380
It's getting late.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.600
Let's all rest early.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.800
Tomorrow morning,

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.190
we'll proceed as planned.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.400
Mr. Chang, remember this:

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.360
tomorrow, you'll be allocated

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.490
200,000 dan of rice,

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:30.840
at 3 taels of silver per dan.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.360
Remember,

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:31.960
cash only.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.960
Absolutely don't sell

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.070
at the price lower than 3 taels per dan.

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:34.730
No problem.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:40.100
[Nantong]

00:35:59.480 --> 00:35:59.880
Sir.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.210
I was meaning to ask you.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.110
About the coastal embankment
repairs in Nantong,

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.690
why haven't you made any arrangements
for it?

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:07.360
I need to lower the rice price first.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.480
This is also helping you, Sir,

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.080
to enhance your reputation.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:12.000
Yes, of course.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.550
By the way,

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:13.620
I've heard that

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.510
Li Qin has already gone to
the Hunan and Hubei area,

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.480
and you've been buying rice

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.860
like crazy in Jinling.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.140
I truly appreciate your efforts,

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.730
spending your own money

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.170
to handle matters for the imperial court.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.150
But there's one thing I don't understand:

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.280
how much money do you two actually have

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.710
to save the people of Nantong?

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:37.440
A bit over a million taels, I suppose.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.510
That's nowhere near enough.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.110
Not enough?

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.070
Then why don't you open the granaries

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.730
and distribute relief grain?

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.120
I don't have any rice.

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:44.590
I have no grain at all.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.510
I've worked out a strategy with Li Qin

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.400
that can bring the rice price back down.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.880
We won't need to spend
a single penny ourselves.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.590
And meanwhile,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.990
we can even make a profit.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:56.840
What do you mean by that?

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.630
Wonderful.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:07.950
That's truly wonderful.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.320
Come on.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.230
Look.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.270
I don't have much money.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.570
This is my salary from all these years,

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:27.440
20,000 taels in total.

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:30.260
Sir,

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.690
I never expected

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.310
you'd offer all your salary.

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.070
Please rest assured.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:35.670
Regarding the rice price,

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:36.710
I will handle it properly.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:37.320
This money,

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.650
I'll make sure it's spent where it counts.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.690
You think I'm making a donation?

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.320
No way.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.310
Count me in as a shareholder.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.290
I want to make some profit too.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.280
The sage once said,

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.190
if you don't take advantage when you can,

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.190
you're a fool.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.970
The sage is truly

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.890
brilliant.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.280
The show is already over,

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.010
yet

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.640
he's still putting on airs.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.190
Mr. Chang.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.960
Please sit down.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.220
I'll get you some rice.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.880
Where's Pingwen?

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.570
I'm here, Mr. Chang.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:32.100
The two of us

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.650
came all the way here,

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.400
haven't even settled down yet,

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.800
and now we have to go back.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.400
Isn't this Yang Ten-Million

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.020
going too far?

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:41.450
That's exactly right.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.440
With all the expenses for food and lodging
on the road,

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.230
if they offer lower than 3 taels,

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:46.190
even a penny less,

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.480
we can't sell it.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:49.010
That's settled then.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.840
As the old saying goes,

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.630
"if you can't play the part well,
better not to play it at all."

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.110
Mr. Chang.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.030
You were amazing.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.110
Master Gu, was it good?

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:55.110
It was excellent.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.070
I'm exhausted.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:56.670
Pingyuan,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.230
why aren't you praising me?

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.080
You didn't even act.
Why should I praise you?

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.190
Alright, alright, good job.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.790
Let's eat.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.280
Everyone.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.430
Today, with just a small trick,

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.280
we've earned

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.440
600,000 taels of silver.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.800
Weren't you supposed to be
saving the people?

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.530
How did you end up making money?

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:11.840
That Yang Ten-Million

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.510
feeds on human flesh
and drinks human blood.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.400
He bought up all the rice

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.110
in Nantong,

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.360
thinking

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.290
he's so capable.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.100
Mr. Liao,

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.280
it's your turn now.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:20.670
Q-Quickly, give me

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:21.470
your costume.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.000
No need.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.320
I had one made

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.320
specially for your size.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.190
Once you put it on,

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.320
you'll look even more impressive
than Mr. Chang.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:27.920
This time,

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.630
we need to make two more shipments.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:31.760
Tomorrow, I'll allocate 600,000 dan
to you;

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.670
and the day after, a million dan.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.410
Remember:

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.070
all has to be sold at 3 taels of silver,

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.400
not a single penny less.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.990
That Yang Ten-Million isn't a fool.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:43.160
Can he handle

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.360
buying so much rice?

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.400
He may not be a fool,

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.720
but he's too greedy.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.400
However much I feed him now,

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.920
he'll have to swallow it all.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.650
I'll stuff him until he bursts.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.970
I have a few friends

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.730
in the rice business in Anhui.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.030
They can pool

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.740
another 2 million dan.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.540
Excellent.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.990
Then I won't trouble another person
for this matter.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.760
From acting to pooling grain,

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.760
you handle it all.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:05.710
Here's what I thought:

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:06.760
after we get this done,

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.800
I want to set aside
500,000 taels of silver

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.880
to buy jewelry for Miss Liao.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.470
What do you think?

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.780
F-Five hundred thousand?

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.440
That's generous,

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.890
but with Mr. Chang here,

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.670
taking so much money

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.780
makes me a bit uncomfortable.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:26.480
Then let's make it less.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.080
No, no, no.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.170
It's settled then.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:31.030
You're selling much more than me,

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:33.090
so you should act more convincingly.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.580
Today,

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.160
I finally got to see

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.150
how despicable Yang Ten-Million was.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.630
If you didn't need to keep up this act,

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:41.030
I would've smashed his nose
with one punch.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.990
He's just a bad guy,

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.160
a complete villain.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:45.590
After I finish eating,

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:46.590
I'll explain everything to you,

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:48.650
then you'll know how to deal with him.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.390
Please skip the meal

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:51.690
and teach me now.

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:53.590
After you've taught me, then you can eat.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:54.710
Let's go have a drink.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:55.400
-Come on.
-Alright, alright.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:55.930
Let's go.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.710
Come on.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:09.320
Profiteer?

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.120
Time to sleep.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.880
I knew

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.160
you'd scold me again.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.180
That you remember quite clearly.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.210
You think I want to keep

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.780
all this money for myself?

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.840
I just hope

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.710
the people of Nantong

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:26.970
can have a better life.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.110
If every

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.320
worker repairing the coastal embankment

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.550
could earn two more candareens daily

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.710
to support their families,

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.030
once the rice price stabilizes

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.440
and the coastal embankment is repaired,

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.370
Nantong will regain its vitality.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:37.960
As the saying goes,

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.230
once you set out to do something,
you must see it through;

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.890
and once you get it done,
you must leave a legacy.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.300
Except for you,

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.220
I don't want to be criticized
by anyone else.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.880
Well, profiteer, you're

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.680
quite the grudge-holder, aren't you?

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:17.400
♪ A single straight purple bamboo ♪

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:23.480
♪ Give the flute made of it to the baby ♪

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.150
♪ The flute to the mouth ♪

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:30.840
♪ The mouth to the flute ♪

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:31.800
Master.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.070
♪ A new tune flows from the flute ♪

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:35.070
Another rice merchant
has arrived in Nantong.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:36.000
He's from Anhui.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.280
Anhui?

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.360
Don't cause trouble for me here.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.030
How much rice did he bring?

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.800
600,000 dan.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:45.730
That's quite a lot.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.840
I heard there's

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.700
another 2 to 3 million dan coming.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:52.240
600,000 dan

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:54.320
and another 3 mill...

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.360
Are you sure you heard it right?

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.130
Absolutely.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.090
So it's 3.6 million dan?

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.760
So much rice—

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:02.070
how could the small city of Nantong

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:03.110
possibly consume it all?
