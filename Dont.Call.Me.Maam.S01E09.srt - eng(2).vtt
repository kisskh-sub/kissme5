Honey.

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.603
Yeah?

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:38.108
I have a favor to ask.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.868
Why don't we...

00:00:44.737 --> 00:00:47.940
just pretend we don't know anything
about Seon Min?

00:00:49.408 --> 00:00:52.478
I know exactly
how much this is eating you up.

00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:53.912
But...

00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:57.850
you know what it meant to me...

00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:00.486
to join this company.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.088
And more than anything,

00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:06.258
we're Min Woo and Min Jun's parents.

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:09.662
As much as it hurts
to see someone treated unfairly,

00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:13.799
keeping our family safe
matters more to me.

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:16.068
So...

00:01:18.237 --> 00:01:19.672
for our family,

00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:23.809
can we just...

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.512
step away from this?

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:39.491
Yeah, let's do that.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.861
Honestly, I'd been thinking
that was the right thing too.

00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:45.698
You've hung in there this far,

00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:47.566
and I don't want you to end up
getting hurt because of this.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.037
I'm really sorry.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.506
Honey, I'm sorry.

00:01:54.506 --> 00:01:57.543
No, it's okay.
I'm the one who's sorry.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.878
I shouldn't have weighed you down
with something like this.

00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:03.115
Let's go to bed.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.517
I have a morning broadcast tomorrow,
so I need to leave early.

00:02:06.952 --> 00:02:07.820
Come to bed.

00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:17.363

00:02:34.513 --> 00:02:36.081
Why does my heart feel so heavy?

00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:39.318
Mom, I want to play with Yun Gwon.

00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:41.320
Can I go over to his house?

00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:44.056
Yun Gwon? Who's that?

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:45.524
Kim Yun Gwon from Sunshine Class.

00:02:45.524 --> 00:02:48.027
So he's not in your class,
but the class next door?

00:02:48.027 --> 00:02:50.930
Yeah, I played with him yesterday,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.433
and the day before,
and the day before that.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:58.103
He's really strong,
and he has tons of toys.

00:02:58.103 --> 00:02:58.971
I see.

00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:00.739
Even at the playground,

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.710
everyone wants to play tag with him.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.946
Can I go to his house?

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.383
You must really like Yun Gwon, Min Woo.

00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:13.652
If you want to go to his house,

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:15.955
we should invite him to our place first.

00:03:15.955 --> 00:03:17.456
Then maybe we can go visit his house.

00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:18.924
I'll ask your teacher.

00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:20.326
Awesome!

00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:22.294
My little princes,
have fun today as always.

00:03:22.294 --> 00:03:23.228
Okay.

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:26.365
Hello.

(Min Woo's Teacher)

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.064
Yes, ma'am.

00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:01.100
Ms. Cho.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.636
There's something I need to talk about.

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.006
After work,
could you stop by for a moment?

00:04:08.073 --> 00:04:09.775
Guys, catch me if you can.

00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:15.247
Min Woo is a witness?

00:04:16.482 --> 00:04:19.118
During recess earlier,

00:04:19.118 --> 00:04:22.187
Yun Gwon, Min Woo, and So Ra
were playing with clay,

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:25.291
and they went to wash their hands.

00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:28.761
Then I heard someone crying,
so I went to check.

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:36.001
My goodness.

00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:37.002
Let me see.

00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:38.370
Goodness.

00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:40.172
Let me see.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.641
Guys, what happened?

00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:45.077
- She suddenly slipped and fell.
- Poor thing.

00:04:45.077 --> 00:04:46.278
So Ra says...

00:04:47.012 --> 00:04:48.614
Yun Gwon pushed her,

00:04:48.614 --> 00:04:51.216
and she hit her head on the floor.

00:04:52.217 --> 00:04:54.153
But Yun Gwon and Min Woo say...

00:04:54.153 --> 00:04:57.990
So Ra slipped on her own and got hurt.

00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.225
Min Woo.

00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:03.495
Did Yun Gwon push So Ra
in the bathroom earlier?

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.197
No.

00:05:06.165 --> 00:05:07.967
You can tell me.

00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:11.770
I wasn't sure,
so I called Min Woo over alone to ask,

00:05:12.338 --> 00:05:14.306
and he also said
what Yun Gwon said was true...

00:05:14.506 --> 00:05:17.643
and that So Ra was lying.

00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:22.948
Anyway, since the only witness
who saw it said it didn't happen,

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:25.150
we let it go for now.

00:05:29.588 --> 00:05:32.958
Min Woo,
I'll ask you this just once, okay?

00:05:33.492 --> 00:05:36.795
I believe you're not someone
who tells lies.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.998
So I will only ask this once.

00:05:38.998 --> 00:05:40.299
Min Woo.

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:43.402
Did you see Yun Gwon push So Ra or not?

00:05:43.402 --> 00:05:45.638
Yun Gwon didn't push her.

00:05:45.638 --> 00:05:48.507
So Ra slipped
and banged her head really hard.

00:05:48.507 --> 00:05:49.241
Really?

00:05:50.376 --> 00:05:52.278
She slipped all by herself?

00:05:52.278 --> 00:05:53.746
Yun Gwon didn't push her?

00:05:53.946 --> 00:05:55.948
No, he didn't!

00:05:55.948 --> 00:05:59.385
Why do you and my teacher keep asking
when I said he didn't?

00:06:00.052 --> 00:06:00.886
Okay, I got it.

00:06:01.887 --> 00:06:04.590
You do not lie, Min Woo.

00:06:04.923 --> 00:06:06.992
You're an honest and good boy.

00:06:07.526 --> 00:06:08.460
Right?

00:06:09.328 --> 00:06:12.031
I believe you, okay?

00:06:15.434 --> 00:06:16.335
You can go.

00:06:29.315 --> 00:06:30.416
Yes, ma'am.

00:06:30.716 --> 00:06:33.185
I just asked Min Woo myself.

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:35.688
He said Yun Gwon didn't push So Ra.

00:06:35.688 --> 00:06:37.589
I think So Ra just thought wrong.

00:06:44.263 --> 00:06:46.198
What are you doing, Il Ri?

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:49.468
Since Sang Gyu and I
both have the day off,

00:06:49.468 --> 00:06:52.137
I was just packing a simple lunch
for a picnic,

00:06:52.137 --> 00:06:54.773
but somehow it turned into all this.
I'm so busy.

00:06:55.174 --> 00:06:56.609
I packed yours too.

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:58.644
Do you call this "simple?"

00:06:58.644 --> 00:07:01.280
People will think you're going out
to sell lunchboxes.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.183
I know, right? Why do they only sell
ingredients in huge packs?

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:08.487
Unbelievable. You made all this?

00:07:08.487 --> 00:07:09.521
Hey!

00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:11.457
Yours is over there.

00:07:12.992 --> 00:07:14.893
That's so unfair.

00:07:15.327 --> 00:07:17.896
Il Ri, you've changed so much.

00:07:18.497 --> 00:07:19.965
Do you like Sang Gyu that much?

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:21.533
What are you talking about?

00:07:21.533 --> 00:07:24.003
I'm only seeing him
because there's no one else.

00:07:24.003 --> 00:07:26.672
If it doesn't feel right,
I'm going to dump him.

00:07:27.172 --> 00:07:28.274
Yeah, sure.

00:07:30.142 --> 00:07:32.845
I should send this to him.

00:07:32.845 --> 00:07:35.214
- I'll show him how excited you are.
- Hey!

00:07:35.214 --> 00:07:37.049
No!

00:07:37.049 --> 00:07:38.250
Come here!

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.286
- Hey!
- Help me!

00:07:40.886 --> 00:07:42.121
Delete it!

00:07:42.121 --> 00:07:43.722
- Do it.
- I'm sorry.

00:07:44.023 --> 00:07:44.857
What?

00:07:45.424 --> 00:07:46.725
Why are you only telling me now?

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:48.394
Well,

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:52.364
it didn't feel like a big deal.

00:07:53.132 --> 00:07:55.200
And there didn't seem
to be any sign of anything,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.969
so I thought I'd just leave it.

00:07:58.304 --> 00:07:59.838
No signs means it's fine?

00:08:00.306 --> 00:08:01.707
Quiet is what's suspicious.

00:08:05.678 --> 00:08:07.346
If Cho Na Jeong finds out...

00:08:07.346 --> 00:08:09.949
and starts digging, and this blows up,
then what?

00:08:15.521 --> 00:08:16.522
How much did you tell her?

00:08:18.757 --> 00:08:22.661
She asked if Noh Won Bin
and Kim Seon Min...

00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:24.196
actually used to date,

00:08:25.164 --> 00:08:26.932
so I just said I'd only heard rumors,

00:08:27.433 --> 00:08:28.968
and that I didn't know for sure.

00:08:29.501 --> 00:08:32.304
If you can't handle things right,
you should at least tell me fast.

00:08:32.304 --> 00:08:34.206
Why can't you do anything properly?

00:08:46.218 --> 00:08:47.219
Get out.

00:09:10.209 --> 00:09:11.377
You called for me?

00:09:11.377 --> 00:09:12.144
Yeah.

00:09:12.444 --> 00:09:13.279
Sit.

00:09:20.085 --> 00:09:23.822
I just wanted to know
how things are at work...

00:09:23.822 --> 00:09:25.090
or if you're having a hard time at all.

00:09:27.726 --> 00:09:30.029
Since you're someone
I've always been fond of,

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:31.530
I feel like I haven't checked in enough.

00:09:32.331 --> 00:09:35.701
Thanks to you,
I'm working hard and enjoying it.

00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:36.602
Good.

00:09:37.036 --> 00:09:38.771
You're doing much better than I expected.

00:09:38.771 --> 00:09:39.872
It makes me proud.

00:09:41.507 --> 00:09:43.509
You brought in a magazine interview...

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:45.811
and saved a broadcast
that almost fell through.

00:09:46.645 --> 00:09:48.981
I can just see you
doing even better from here.

00:09:51.884 --> 00:09:53.185
When you think about it,

00:09:53.552 --> 00:09:55.454
you're here thanks to me.

00:09:57.089 --> 00:10:00.426
Back at the marketing company
you used to work at,

00:10:00.626 --> 00:10:03.062
when the announcer bailed
at the car launch event,

00:10:03.062 --> 00:10:05.598
I saw you MC that
and thought you'd be a great show host.

00:10:05.598 --> 00:10:06.865
That's why you applied, right?

00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:09.001
Yes.

00:10:09.868 --> 00:10:13.172
Thanks to you, I was able
to take a shot at being a show host.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.041
When you put it that way,

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:19.345
I'm kind of a special benefactor
to you, right?

00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:22.214
I'm truly grateful.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.153
I'm not saying this
just to pat myself on the back.

00:10:29.555 --> 00:10:33.359
I'm saying I have a reason
I can't help but feel...

00:10:33.359 --> 00:10:34.393
especially attached to you.

00:10:38.364 --> 00:10:39.765
The truth is, Na Jeong,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.368
I've been feeling...

00:10:43.335 --> 00:10:44.336
so lonely lately.

00:10:45.037 --> 00:10:47.439
You'll understand when you're a bit older.

00:10:48.574 --> 00:10:51.577
Holding on as a working mom...

00:10:51.577 --> 00:10:52.645
is really no small thing.

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:55.748
Even though she's in college now,

00:10:55.748 --> 00:10:57.249
my daughter's still not grown up.

00:10:58.117 --> 00:10:59.418
And my husband,

00:10:59.952 --> 00:11:02.087
like all husbands,
isn't on my side at all.

00:11:09.028 --> 00:11:12.164
Let's stay close,
not just as boss and employee,

00:11:13.132 --> 00:11:16.035
but as fellow working moms
for a long, long time.

00:11:19.638 --> 00:11:20.940
Just keep doing what you're doing.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.008
Don't cause any weird trouble.

00:11:23.776 --> 00:11:26.712
Then in the end,
the one who gets the contract...

00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:28.881
will be you.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:31.917
All right?

00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:35.187
Yes, I'll do my best.

00:11:57.142 --> 00:11:58.243
Na Jeong.

00:11:58.243 --> 00:12:01.447
Father, my meeting ended early today.

00:12:01.447 --> 00:12:03.282
So I'll go pick up the kids.

00:12:03.616 --> 00:12:04.850
Okay, get some rest.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:05.751
Yes.

00:12:30.276 --> 00:12:33.812
I can't believe
you thought to pack such a pretty lunch.

00:12:34.413 --> 00:12:36.615
I just happened to wake up early,

00:12:36.615 --> 00:12:38.917
so I threw together
whatever I had at home.

00:12:38.917 --> 00:12:40.119
I didn't want to eat delivery food.

00:12:40.119 --> 00:12:41.053
Amazing.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.056
I'm falling for Lee Il Ri
all over again today.

00:12:44.757 --> 00:12:46.125
Why do you look
so pretty today, especially?

00:12:46.992 --> 00:12:50.095
That's not just how it feels, it's a fact.

00:12:51.897 --> 00:12:52.865
Right, a fact.

00:12:59.071 --> 00:13:00.172
Il Ri, careful.

00:13:02.241 --> 00:13:05.177
You almost got hurt.

00:13:05.177 --> 00:13:07.179
What's with this natural physical contact?

00:13:08.147 --> 00:13:10.115
Physical contact?
What are you talking about?

00:13:10.849 --> 00:13:11.650
Let's go.

00:13:15.854 --> 00:13:17.156
It seems you've dated a bit.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:19.959
If you're 40 and you've never dated once,

00:13:19.959 --> 00:13:21.427
that'd be weirder.

00:13:22.227 --> 00:13:23.062
True.

00:13:23.529 --> 00:13:26.131
How many people have you dated?

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:29.802
If you keep talking like this,

00:13:29.802 --> 00:13:31.236
I feel like I shouldn't let myself
get swept up in it.

00:13:31.236 --> 00:13:32.204
Hey.

00:13:32.438 --> 00:13:34.573
Do I look like someone that uptight?

00:13:35.074 --> 00:13:37.610
Come on, tell me.
How many have you dated?

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.647
Not many. At most, three?

00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:45.117
Really? That's it?

00:13:46.218 --> 00:13:48.587
How long did you date them?

00:13:49.588 --> 00:13:51.390
Two were short,

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.959
and one was a bit longer.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.228
So how long?

00:13:59.064 --> 00:13:59.932
Three years.

00:14:03.469 --> 00:14:06.538
You're a lot more
steady and devoted than I thought.

00:14:07.606 --> 00:14:09.375
What did she do?

00:14:10.409 --> 00:14:12.244
She was a doctor
who worked with me at the hospital.

00:14:13.212 --> 00:14:14.880
Great job too.

00:14:15.948 --> 00:14:17.850
Then why did you break up?

00:14:18.417 --> 00:14:20.786
There's never just one reason
people break up.

00:14:20.786 --> 00:14:22.254
A few things...

00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:27.126
Are you upset?

00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:30.896
Wait. Are you jealous right now?

00:14:31.597 --> 00:14:33.532
What are you saying? Why would I be?

00:14:33.532 --> 00:14:34.800
Over something like this?

00:14:36.402 --> 00:14:37.937
Yes, she's totally jealous.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.578
This is so good.

00:14:46.578 --> 00:14:49.214
Il Ri, you're not just pretty.

00:14:49.214 --> 00:14:50.883
You're a really good cook too.

00:14:51.617 --> 00:14:53.352
Why aren't you eating?
Are you on a diet?

00:14:54.053 --> 00:14:56.121
I told you already.

00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:57.823
You don't have any weight to lose.

00:14:58.057 --> 00:14:59.458
Was she good at cooking too?

00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:00.993
What?

00:15:00.993 --> 00:15:02.861
I mean, think about it.

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:06.498
If you dated for three years,
she must've packed you lunch 100 times.

00:15:06.498 --> 00:15:09.401
You must've talked
about marriage 1,000 times.

00:15:09.401 --> 00:15:12.404
I'm just curious
if she was any good at cooking.

00:15:12.905 --> 00:15:14.707
No, she couldn't cook at all.

00:15:14.707 --> 00:15:16.375
If anything got cooked,
I was the one who did it.

00:15:23.082 --> 00:15:26.685
You cooked for her?

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.388
I guess you really liked her.

00:15:30.489 --> 00:15:32.157
Then why did you break up?

00:15:33.659 --> 00:15:34.960
Are you still not over her?

00:15:35.828 --> 00:15:37.696
No, it's not like that.

00:15:37.696 --> 00:15:38.664
Really?

00:15:38.664 --> 00:15:40.933
- What I'm saying is...
- Why are you stuttering?

00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:42.568
Did I hit a nerve?

00:15:44.837 --> 00:15:48.107
Why are you acting like this?

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.009
You said some 40-year-old
with no dating experience...

00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:51.510
would be even more burdensome.

00:15:51.877 --> 00:15:54.580
You told me to relax,
so I told you everything.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.482
What am I supposed to do
if you react like this?

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.952
Then don't pretend
to be all pure and devoted.

00:15:59.952 --> 00:16:01.620
Don't make someone's heart flutter
and then say that.

00:16:02.254 --> 00:16:04.156
You said you couldn't forget me for years.

00:16:04.723 --> 00:16:06.125
You said that I was your first love.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:08.861
Wait.

00:16:09.762 --> 00:16:11.130
Il Ri.

00:16:14.733 --> 00:16:16.001
Il Ri, hold on.

00:16:17.469 --> 00:16:18.370
No, Il Ri.

00:16:19.171 --> 00:16:20.706
This is bad.

00:16:30.716 --> 00:16:32.751
So embarrassing!

00:16:34.086 --> 00:16:37.289
Why did I do that? How pathetic.

00:16:37.289 --> 00:16:38.924
Why!

00:16:40.359 --> 00:16:42.328
This is so annoying.

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:46.198
We're home, Grandpa.

00:16:46.198 --> 00:16:47.199
Guys.

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:48.367
We're home.

00:16:48.367 --> 00:16:49.501
Hey.

00:16:49.501 --> 00:16:53.038
Did you boys play so hard
to get all sweaty like this?

00:16:53.038 --> 00:16:55.107
Take off your things.
Let's get washed up.

00:16:55.107 --> 00:16:56.909
It's okay. I'll wash them.

00:16:56.909 --> 00:16:58.177
No.

00:16:58.177 --> 00:17:00.813
You must be hungry.
Wash up and eat first.

00:17:00.813 --> 00:17:03.082
I made delicious soybean paste stew.

00:17:03.849 --> 00:17:05.017
Thank you, Father.

00:17:05.017 --> 00:17:07.953
All right then, let's go wash up now.

00:17:43.856 --> 00:17:44.757
Noh Min Woo.

00:17:45.524 --> 00:17:47.526
Who gave you this toy?

00:17:48.327 --> 00:17:49.862
A friend.

00:17:51.063 --> 00:17:52.131
Which friend?

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.635
Why can't you say
which friend gave it to you?

00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:58.637
Are you sure a friend gave it?

00:17:58.637 --> 00:18:00.606
Did you bring home
a toy from your classroom?

00:18:00.873 --> 00:18:03.075
No, it's not from my class.

00:18:03.075 --> 00:18:04.376
A friend gave it to me.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.246
Which friend gave it?

00:18:07.246 --> 00:18:08.580
Why can't you say?

00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:12.584
Yun Gwon.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.688
Yun Gwon?

00:18:16.889 --> 00:18:18.524
Why did he give this to you?

00:18:20.659 --> 00:18:21.760
Just because.

00:18:22.695 --> 00:18:23.862
Tell me the truth.

00:18:24.296 --> 00:18:26.932
Why did he suddenly give this to you?

00:18:30.469 --> 00:18:31.437
Don't tell me...

00:18:32.638 --> 00:18:34.707
you lied to me about that back then?

00:18:39.878 --> 00:18:42.915
Mom, I'm sorry.
That time, Yun Gwon...

00:18:46.352 --> 00:18:50.322
pushed So Ra,
and she hit her head really hard.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.026
When I tried to tell the teacher,

00:18:54.026 --> 00:18:56.262
he told me not to and gave me this.

00:18:56.795 --> 00:18:58.998
He said I'm his friend,

00:18:58.998 --> 00:19:00.633
not So Ra's friend.

00:19:05.304 --> 00:19:07.273
Since I'm his friend,

00:19:07.273 --> 00:19:09.642
he told me not to tell and gave it to me.

00:19:10.009 --> 00:19:12.244
How could you tell a lie like that?

00:19:12.244 --> 00:19:13.779
Your friend got hurt.

00:19:15.014 --> 00:19:17.650
And because of your lie,
she didn't even get an apology,

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:18.917
and ended up looking
like she was the liar!

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:22.054
How could you do that!

00:19:23.889 --> 00:19:26.659
Mom, I was wrong.

00:19:26.659 --> 00:19:28.661
I'm sorry.

00:19:29.828 --> 00:19:32.464
He said nobody saw it,

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.034
so as long as I stayed quiet,
it would be fine.

00:19:35.034 --> 00:19:37.803
He said if just the two of us
didn't say anything, it'd be fine.

00:19:37.803 --> 00:19:40.239
Even if other people don't know, you do.

00:19:40.673 --> 00:19:42.508
I read you that book about conscience.

00:19:43.142 --> 00:19:44.576
If you lie like that,

00:19:45.077 --> 00:19:48.614
- you cannot grow up to be a good person.
- Mom.

00:19:49.348 --> 00:19:51.317
I'm sorry.

00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:58.157
I'm sorry.

00:20:10.769 --> 00:20:12.871
(Conscience Did It!)

00:20:17.209 --> 00:20:18.811
(It was Conscience who did it!)

00:20:19.211 --> 00:20:21.447
(The teacher asked,
"Did you finish your homework?")

00:20:21.447 --> 00:20:23.182
(But Min Su had forgotten
he even had homework.)

00:20:23.749 --> 00:20:24.984
(Then Conscience inside him said,)

00:20:24.984 --> 00:20:26.452
("Lies will make your heart heavy.")

00:20:26.452 --> 00:20:27.920
("If you're honest,
both your heart and I become lighter.")

00:20:57.683 --> 00:20:58.617
Honey, I'm home.

00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:07.059
Why are you sitting like that?

00:21:12.231 --> 00:21:13.098
Honey.

00:21:13.098 --> 00:21:13.899
Yeah?

00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:16.001
Let's just...

00:21:17.036 --> 00:21:20.406
report what happened to Seon Min
to the ethics committee.

00:21:22.207 --> 00:21:23.008
Why?

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.444
Did something happen?

00:21:29.615 --> 00:21:31.317
Actually,

00:21:31.317 --> 00:21:33.285
a few days ago at kindergarten,

00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:35.621
Min Woo saw a friend hit another kid.

00:21:36.021 --> 00:21:37.623
But he let a toy sway him...

00:21:39.224 --> 00:21:40.893
into lying to his teacher and to me,

00:21:41.594 --> 00:21:43.295
like it was nothing.

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:48.067
So today,

00:21:48.367 --> 00:21:50.569
after scolding him, I started thinking.

00:21:52.638 --> 00:21:53.606
If I just turn a blind eye...

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.775
to Seon Min's case,

00:21:57.876 --> 00:22:00.012
I'm the same as Min Woo.

00:22:03.482 --> 00:22:05.751
What right do I have to teach my kids?

00:22:07.319 --> 00:22:08.454
What right?

00:22:33.279 --> 00:22:36.882
(The wife didn't know the secret
her husband couldn't talk about.)

00:22:39.285 --> 00:22:40.152
Hey.

00:22:40.519 --> 00:22:44.590
They maybe there's something...

00:22:46.692 --> 00:22:49.528
your husband and my husband
couldn't tell us...

00:22:49.528 --> 00:22:52.331
because we're family.

00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:05.978
(People who love dolls)

00:23:10.382 --> 00:23:11.884
(Why some adults still need dolls)

00:23:11.884 --> 00:23:13.919
(The psychological mechanisms
that compensate for loneliness)

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:16.288
(Objectophilia and Paraphilia)

00:23:20.592 --> 00:23:22.061
(Objectophilia)

00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:24.930
(A type of paraphilia...)

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.399
(focused on non-moving,
specific objects...)

00:23:37.509 --> 00:23:40.446
(Mother)

00:23:45.084 --> 00:23:47.486
You must be surprised
I asked to meet like this.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.254
Not at all.

00:23:49.254 --> 00:23:54.326
I also felt like
we shouldn't leave everything to them,

00:23:54.326 --> 00:23:56.862
so I'd been meaning
to ask for a meeting myself.

00:23:59.131 --> 00:24:01.834
Then, tell us now.

00:24:02.801 --> 00:24:04.770
Why are you two trying to get divorced?

00:24:05.437 --> 00:24:06.872
No matter what the reason is,

00:24:06.872 --> 00:24:09.108
how do you go off and stamp
divorce papers on your own...

00:24:09.108 --> 00:24:11.677
without saying a word to the parents?

00:24:11.677 --> 00:24:12.778
I'm sorry.

00:24:13.312 --> 00:24:16.582
That can happen when you're young.

00:24:17.216 --> 00:24:20.085
When you're young and your temper flares,

00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:22.288
you can feel like ending everything.

00:24:22.554 --> 00:24:25.024
But if you got divorced every time
you felt like that,

00:24:25.024 --> 00:24:28.160
how many couples would even be left
in this country?

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.528
Mom, I already told you.

00:24:29.528 --> 00:24:31.230
It wasn't Joo Young who asked
for the divorce. It was me.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:33.666
Why do you keep
blaming Joo Young for nothing?

00:24:33.666 --> 00:24:36.835
She agreed to it too,
otherwise there wouldn't be a divorce.

00:24:36.835 --> 00:24:38.704
You're a mild, soft kid.

00:24:38.704 --> 00:24:41.707
There's no way you were the one
who took the lead and pushed for it.

00:24:42.675 --> 00:24:46.245
Did I ever nag you for not having a child?

00:24:46.245 --> 00:24:48.213
Did I ever give you attitude over it?

00:24:48.213 --> 00:24:51.183
I was as careful as I could be.

00:24:51.183 --> 00:24:53.485
And now, after all that,
to get blindsided like this,

00:24:53.485 --> 00:24:56.121
I'm just stunned and furious.

00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:57.022
Ma'am.

00:24:57.289 --> 00:25:00.192
I've kept quiet,
but what you're saying isn't right.

00:25:00.492 --> 00:25:01.635
So you're saying...

00:25:01.636 --> 00:25:05.431
the fact that they were childless
is my daughter's fault?

00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:08.334
And you think the divorce
is because of her too?

00:25:09.401 --> 00:25:11.003
No, that's not what I meant.

00:25:11.003 --> 00:25:12.371
Let's be blunt here.

00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:14.573
Isn't the fault...

00:25:15.341 --> 00:25:17.042
one hundred percent on Sang Min?

00:25:17.943 --> 00:25:19.545
What are you talking about?

00:25:20.212 --> 00:25:21.213
You know it's true.

00:25:21.513 --> 00:25:24.183
If he didn't have those twisted hobbies,

00:25:24.183 --> 00:25:25.784
do you think it would've come to this?

00:25:26.185 --> 00:25:28.320
Mom, why are you doing this?
Please stop.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.923
Don't butt in when the elders are talking.

00:25:31.557 --> 00:25:32.491
Ma'am.

00:25:32.791 --> 00:25:35.294
Your son, Sang Min,

00:25:35.294 --> 00:25:39.131
talks to life-size dolls,
takes pictures with them,

00:25:39.131 --> 00:25:41.100
and badmouthes Joo Young.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.902
Did you know that?

00:25:44.503 --> 00:25:47.973
I just heard he liked dolls,

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.042
so I thought he was a kidult...

00:25:50.042 --> 00:25:53.212
or whatever they call it these days.

00:25:53.879 --> 00:25:54.780
But...

00:25:55.314 --> 00:25:59.118
how could he like dolls
instead of a person?

00:26:00.286 --> 00:26:02.488
Even I almost fainted
when I saw that doll's head.

00:26:02.488 --> 00:26:03.922
Imagine how Joo Young must've felt.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.092
He likes things like that,
so no wonder they couldn't have a child.

00:26:07.092 --> 00:26:08.827
How is any of that Joo Young's fault?

00:26:09.295 --> 00:26:11.463
Mom, why are you being so rude?

00:26:11.764 --> 00:26:13.132
Leave, now.

00:26:13.132 --> 00:26:14.500
We should leave.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.001
What's wrong with you?

00:26:16.001 --> 00:26:17.036
Let go of me.

00:26:18.137 --> 00:26:20.406
Who are you calling a pervert right now?

00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:21.874
You don't even know anything.

00:26:23.175 --> 00:26:24.143
Those dolls...

00:26:25.878 --> 00:26:29.248
are not the weird kind of dolls
you're imagining, ma'am.

00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:31.483
Those dolls,

00:26:32.718 --> 00:26:33.986
when he was a kid...

00:26:33.986 --> 00:26:35.587
Mom, stop!

00:26:35.587 --> 00:26:37.456
Why? What did I do wrong?

00:26:38.023 --> 00:26:39.024
You have to speak up.

00:26:39.024 --> 00:26:41.560
Enough, please.
You're going to kill me.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.028
Why?

00:26:43.429 --> 00:26:47.433
You should speak up if you're wronged!

00:26:47.433 --> 00:26:48.267
I'm sorry.

00:26:52.738 --> 00:26:54.406
What on earth are you doing?

00:26:54.873 --> 00:26:57.643
Why are you taking your anger out on me?

00:26:58.077 --> 00:27:00.112
How could you say that...

00:27:00.512 --> 00:27:02.114
in front of Sang Min and his mother?

00:27:03.148 --> 00:27:06.485
Can't you even imagine
how deeply that must have hurt them?

00:27:07.419 --> 00:27:10.689
When she makes it sound
like the divorce is entirely your fault,

00:27:10.689 --> 00:27:12.091
I'm just supposed to sit there
and take it like an idiot?

00:27:12.091 --> 00:27:14.293
Why are you trying to control my life...

00:27:14.293 --> 00:27:16.161
even when I'm over 40?

00:27:16.161 --> 00:27:17.730
I'll handle my own life!

00:27:20.933 --> 00:27:24.036
Whether you're 40, 50, or 60,

00:27:24.036 --> 00:27:26.872
you'll always be a child I worry about.

00:27:26.872 --> 00:27:30.242
I'm constantly on edge,
wondering if you'll get hurt.

00:27:30.743 --> 00:27:32.845
And that's what you say
to a mom like that?

00:27:33.746 --> 00:27:34.647
Right.

00:27:35.848 --> 00:27:38.117
I've always been grateful...

00:27:38.617 --> 00:27:40.319
that you cared about me and cherished me.

00:27:41.587 --> 00:27:44.223
So even when Min Young
was acting out and going astray,

00:27:44.223 --> 00:27:45.624
I didn't want to give you a hard time,

00:27:45.624 --> 00:27:48.160
and I avoided anything I knew you'd hate.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.561
But for how long?

00:27:50.863 --> 00:27:52.898
I have to live my life too.

00:27:53.332 --> 00:27:55.534
How long do I have to live
as your good little daughter?

00:27:56.168 --> 00:27:57.937
Can you please just let me go now?

00:27:58.637 --> 00:28:00.839
You think I'm doing this for myself?

00:28:00.839 --> 00:28:02.374
I'm doing all of this for...

00:28:02.374 --> 00:28:04.209
Whether I end up doing well or not,

00:28:04.743 --> 00:28:06.845
whether I ruin my life or crash and burn,

00:28:07.379 --> 00:28:09.548
that's all mine to bear.

00:28:09.548 --> 00:28:10.950
It's not yours, Mom!

00:28:21.427 --> 00:28:23.529
(Sweet Home Shopping)

00:28:27.466 --> 00:28:28.367
Yes?

00:28:28.567 --> 00:28:29.868
Head of division, Kim Jeong Sik?

00:28:31.804 --> 00:28:32.671
Yes.

00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:34.740
This is the Ethics Committee
at headquarters.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.008
What is this regarding?

00:28:37.042 --> 00:28:38.143
Sexual harassment?

00:28:39.612 --> 00:28:41.480
How could anyone make up
such a ridiculous accusation?

00:28:43.382 --> 00:28:44.883
Do you know how upright I am?

00:28:44.883 --> 00:28:47.019
How can you accuse me
of something so absurd?

00:28:49.922 --> 00:28:51.790
Here's what actually happened.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.893
That employee, Kim Seon Min,
was terrible at her job.

00:28:54.893 --> 00:28:56.462
Her sales were awful.

00:28:56.462 --> 00:28:58.631
We kept getting complaints
from our partner companies.

00:28:58.631 --> 00:29:02.201
As the division head in charge,
could I just sit back and watch?

00:29:02.468 --> 00:29:04.803
I had no choice but to pull her
from the programming lineup.

00:29:05.137 --> 00:29:06.405
I even explained it to her.

00:29:07.439 --> 00:29:08.841
Then...

00:29:10.109 --> 00:29:12.411
she started
physically throwing herself at me.

00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:14.880
So I told her firmly,

00:29:16.348 --> 00:29:19.518
"Seon Min, you can't live like this."

00:29:20.953 --> 00:29:22.254
But instead of reflecting on herself,

00:29:23.922 --> 00:29:26.659
she held a grudge...

00:29:26.659 --> 00:29:29.962
and dragged in Producer Noh
and demanded I apologize.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.031
Then...

00:29:33.599 --> 00:29:36.235
why did you send these messages?

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.505
(Seon Min, what does that make me
if you leave like that?)

00:29:39.505 --> 00:29:41.307
(Seon Min, if you're free tonight,
let's have dinner together.)

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.578
A boss can't even ask a subordinate...

00:29:46.578 --> 00:29:49.014
to grab a meal?

00:29:49.648 --> 00:29:51.083
And that second one.

00:29:51.684 --> 00:29:54.720
I only sent that because she stormed out
angry after I pulled her from the lineup.

00:29:55.621 --> 00:29:56.889
I was trying to calm her down.

00:29:58.757 --> 00:30:00.225
Then, what about this?

00:30:01.794 --> 00:30:04.630
(I accuse Sweet Home Shopping's
Division Head K of sexual harassment.)

00:30:07.132 --> 00:30:08.567
Anyone could have written that...

00:30:08.567 --> 00:30:11.370
even if it wasn't Kim Seon Min.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.205
It's 100 percent fabricated.

00:30:13.205 --> 00:30:14.139
Then,

00:30:15.074 --> 00:30:15.874
what about this?

00:30:16.809 --> 00:30:18.110
It gives a very specific account...

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.012
of the harassment she says she suffered.

00:30:20.012 --> 00:30:22.815
(From the physical contact, I've suffered
from severe stress and insomnia...)

00:30:26.151 --> 00:30:27.319
How are you supposed to trust that?

00:30:28.554 --> 00:30:31.624
Anyone can go to a psychiatrist
and say they were harassed...

00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:34.927
and get a report.
You can do that anywhere, can't you?

00:30:55.281 --> 00:30:59.952
(Ethics Committee)

00:31:08.294 --> 00:31:09.194
How did it go?

00:31:09.795 --> 00:31:11.864
Damn it. They clearly don't believe me.

00:31:13.465 --> 00:31:15.267
And somehow that punk managed
to get his hands...

00:31:15.834 --> 00:31:18.737
on Kim Seon Min's psychiatric report.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.386
What's going on?

00:32:10.222 --> 00:32:11.523
I just need to know this.

00:32:13.025 --> 00:32:15.861
You've never told anyone...

00:32:15.861 --> 00:32:17.196
about what happened
with the division head, right?

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.334
No.

00:32:23.736 --> 00:32:26.538
Won Bin or Na Jeong
haven't approached you either?

00:32:30.009 --> 00:32:31.610
No, they haven't.

00:32:32.911 --> 00:32:34.947
Good. That's a relief.

00:32:36.248 --> 00:32:38.250
The thing is,

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.352
Won Bin has got it into his head
to play hero,

00:32:40.352 --> 00:32:43.188
and he's poking around
Seon Min's case for no reason.

00:32:44.023 --> 00:32:47.059
If you get dragged into that,
it won't just be bad for you.

00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:49.361
It could put
all of Sweet Home Shopping at risk.

00:32:50.562 --> 00:32:52.031
The industry's struggling as it is.

00:32:52.031 --> 00:32:53.666
I don't know why
he's being so thoughtless.

00:32:55.634 --> 00:32:56.969
It's driving me crazy.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.739
Honestly, in office life,

00:33:01.106 --> 00:33:03.876
if you react too sensitively
to guys' clueless behavior,

00:33:03.876 --> 00:33:06.512
you know it's only the women
who end up exhausted, right?

00:33:08.514 --> 00:33:11.383
The division head has
nasty drinking habits, sure.

00:33:12.918 --> 00:33:14.420
But he doesn't do it on purpose.

00:33:15.754 --> 00:33:17.990
He's just got
that overly boyish personality.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.392
When he likes someone,
he's the type who can't hide it at all.

00:33:23.329 --> 00:33:24.296
Right.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.199
Do you still want to switch over...

00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:28.667
to fashion?

00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:33.105
The 11 p.m. primetime segment...

00:33:33.105 --> 00:33:35.274
keeps losing out to other channels,

00:33:35.274 --> 00:33:37.109
so we're thinking of revamping it.

00:33:38.611 --> 00:33:40.479
How about trying a fashion segment?

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.315
Do you want me to suggest it
to the programming team?

00:33:57.796 --> 00:33:59.164
(Sweet Home Shopping
Ethics Committee)

00:33:59.164 --> 00:34:01.166
Show host Kim Seon Min...

00:34:02.401 --> 00:34:03.502
once told me...

00:34:04.837 --> 00:34:08.073
she and Producer Noh
had feelings for each other,

00:34:09.308 --> 00:34:11.510
and that it was hard on her.

00:34:12.444 --> 00:34:16.148
I did tell her it wasn't right.

00:34:20.919 --> 00:34:22.554
Honestly, for a long time,

00:34:22.554 --> 00:34:25.224
there have been all kinds of rumors
about those two.

00:34:26.025 --> 00:34:28.193
Think about it.

00:34:28.928 --> 00:34:31.297
Isn't it suspicious in itself...

00:34:31.297 --> 00:34:32.531
that some random third party
filed the report?

00:34:34.099 --> 00:34:35.901
Once the affair rumors started spreading,

00:34:35.901 --> 00:34:38.137
they pulled this to cover it up.

00:34:39.104 --> 00:34:41.674
They're trying to bury me
by painting me as a sexual predator.

00:34:46.478 --> 00:34:47.413
That's not true!

00:34:47.947 --> 00:34:49.348
It's absolutely not true!

00:34:49.348 --> 00:34:50.883
I already told you.

00:34:51.216 --> 00:34:53.085
The story got twisted
because I met her to help her.

00:34:53.352 --> 00:34:56.455
How can you distort it like this?

00:34:56.455 --> 00:34:57.990
We're going to put this on hold.

00:34:58.857 --> 00:34:59.858
On hold?

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.395
Are you saying
we should just sweep it under the rug?

00:35:03.963 --> 00:35:05.864
As long as the person directly involved
is unconscious,

00:35:05.864 --> 00:35:08.834
there's a limit to how clearly
we can establish the facts.

00:35:08.834 --> 00:35:10.669
And with both sides' claims
being so completely opposed,

00:35:12.137 --> 00:35:14.139
it's hard for us to make a quick decision.

00:35:14.139 --> 00:35:16.075
How can you say that?

00:35:16.075 --> 00:35:18.611
I came to the ethics committee
knowing I could face retaliation.

00:35:18.611 --> 00:35:22.047
We are honoring
our whistleblower protection policy.

00:35:22.047 --> 00:35:23.349
So please don't worry too much.

00:35:24.049 --> 00:35:27.920
We'll discuss this further
and get back to you.

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:34.827
Why did Ye Na do that?

00:35:36.695 --> 00:35:37.730
Actually,

00:35:38.664 --> 00:35:39.832
Ye Na is a victim too.

00:35:40.866 --> 00:35:42.635
What? A victim?

00:35:44.169 --> 00:35:46.739
So I tried to persuade her
to file the report with Seon Min,

00:35:47.139 --> 00:35:48.807
but she was adamant.

00:35:48.807 --> 00:35:49.942
She kept saying
nothing like that ever happened.

00:35:52.278 --> 00:35:53.212
In my opinion,

00:35:54.179 --> 00:35:56.215
those guys probably used that as leverage,

00:35:56.915 --> 00:35:58.751
and they're manipulating her
however they want.

00:36:06.925 --> 00:36:08.294
You resented me a lot, right?

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.464
I'm sorry.

00:36:13.999 --> 00:36:15.701
But I was so scared.

00:36:16.268 --> 00:36:18.270
I was afraid
I'd get blacklisted in the industry.

00:36:21.206 --> 00:36:22.574
How could they do that?

00:36:23.542 --> 00:36:24.910
Using a victim like that?

(Executive Director Seo Gyeong Seon)

00:36:39.525 --> 00:36:40.392
Hey.

00:36:41.427 --> 00:36:44.430
Did you know
Won Bin was planning to report...

00:36:45.364 --> 00:36:47.132
the division head to the ethics committee?

00:36:49.702 --> 00:36:50.869
I knew.

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:52.771
And you just watched?

00:36:53.572 --> 00:36:55.474
After everything I've done for you,

00:36:55.874 --> 00:36:58.611
this is how you stab me in the back?

00:36:59.211 --> 00:37:00.446
To be precise,

00:37:01.046 --> 00:37:02.982
it's not you, but the division head.

00:37:03.949 --> 00:37:06.919
You know very well...

00:37:07.252 --> 00:37:08.554
that this is wrong too, don't you?

00:37:11.123 --> 00:37:12.491
It seems...

00:37:12.491 --> 00:37:15.060
you weren't just aware of it.
You encouraged it.

00:37:20.199 --> 00:37:21.667
I also struggled a lot.

00:37:22.868 --> 00:37:24.570
I respected you, Executive Director.

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.905
I wanted your approval
more than anyone else's.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.275
But this isn't right.

00:37:30.042 --> 00:37:31.076
Using a victim...

00:37:31.076 --> 00:37:33.178
and framing an innocent person?

00:37:33.679 --> 00:37:35.414
Even if Producer Noh upset you,

00:37:36.782 --> 00:37:38.117
this isn't right.

00:37:45.691 --> 00:37:47.493
Hey, Cho Na Jeong.

00:37:47.826 --> 00:37:50.296
You're seriously mistaken.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:54.934
The innocent one isn't Won Bin,
but the division head.

00:37:54.934 --> 00:37:57.002
Ye Na wasn't being controlled.

00:37:57.002 --> 00:37:58.837
She was just telling the truth.

00:38:11.817 --> 00:38:14.687
By the way, I've got a question for you.

00:38:15.287 --> 00:38:16.121
What?

00:38:16.889 --> 00:38:18.991
Why did you like me?

00:38:18.991 --> 00:38:20.759
That's embarrassing.

00:38:20.759 --> 00:38:22.528
Do I really have to say that out loud?

00:38:22.528 --> 00:38:24.363
Yes, I need to hear it!

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.334
Did you just kind of like me?
Or did you feel a spark?

00:38:29.234 --> 00:38:30.569
Of course, there was a spark.

00:38:31.103 --> 00:38:33.439
And the more I saw you,
the more charming you got.

00:38:33.439 --> 00:38:34.373
It was both.

00:38:35.307 --> 00:38:38.711
Then what kind of women
were you usually drawn to?

00:38:39.912 --> 00:38:41.981
I never really thought about it.

00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:44.116
You told Joo Young before...

00:38:44.116 --> 00:38:46.185
that you like cheerful
and confident types.

00:38:46.185 --> 00:38:48.287
And you don't like women
who are too immature.

00:38:48.287 --> 00:38:51.090
Right. I do like that kind of style.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.358
Someone independent and confident.

00:38:53.926 --> 00:38:57.763
Then was she like that too?

00:38:58.197 --> 00:38:59.098
She?

00:38:59.298 --> 00:39:00.065
Who?

00:39:00.065 --> 00:39:03.068
That doctor you dated for three years.

00:39:05.037 --> 00:39:08.073
I just wondered...

00:39:08.073 --> 00:39:10.276
if there's some common type you like.

00:39:11.844 --> 00:39:12.711
Is that so?

00:39:13.445 --> 00:39:16.515
Now that I think about it,
maybe she was a bit like that too.

00:39:17.616 --> 00:39:18.450
Really?

00:39:19.151 --> 00:39:20.753
But that's not easy.

00:39:21.487 --> 00:39:24.523
Being cheerful and confident,
yet also thoughtful.

00:39:27.092 --> 00:39:28.360
Is she married now?

00:39:29.161 --> 00:39:30.763
Why? Are you curious?

00:39:30.763 --> 00:39:32.531
Just asking.

00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:35.467
You know everything about my ex,
but I don't know anything about yours.

00:39:35.467 --> 00:39:37.202
It feels unfair.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:38.737
She's not married yet.

00:39:39.004 --> 00:39:40.773
I'm not sure why.

00:39:43.008 --> 00:39:43.876
Hey.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.278
There's nothing to worry about.

00:39:48.781 --> 00:39:51.317
What do you mean "worry?"

00:39:51.317 --> 00:39:53.352
I was just messing around.

00:39:53.352 --> 00:39:56.388
I pretend to be jealous for fun,
and you think it's real?

00:39:59.091 --> 00:39:59.925
Is that it?

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.528
I'm going to the restroom for a sec.

00:40:10.536 --> 00:40:12.972
It's ridiculous how much this bugs me.

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:41.000
What are you doing?

00:40:43.035 --> 00:40:43.869
Excuse me.

00:40:45.537 --> 00:40:46.538
Lee Il Ri.

00:40:47.573 --> 00:40:49.074
What are you doing right now?

00:40:49.775 --> 00:40:51.210
Are you spying on my phone?

00:40:52.044 --> 00:40:53.112
Are you getting jealous?

00:40:58.684 --> 00:41:00.953
What are you so curious about?

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.421
I'll show you.

00:41:03.088 --> 00:41:04.690
What do you want to see?

00:41:04.923 --> 00:41:05.758
This?

00:41:07.993 --> 00:41:11.196
Ads, restaurant picks, tours.

00:41:11.196 --> 00:41:12.464
"Today's top pick."

00:41:12.464 --> 00:41:13.832
Is this what you wanted to see?

00:41:13.832 --> 00:41:15.668
What else? Jong Seok says,

00:41:15.668 --> 00:41:16.835
"Hey, where are you?"

00:41:16.835 --> 00:41:19.238
"I'm having a drink with Hyeong Guk.
Do you want to come?"

00:41:19.238 --> 00:41:22.007
"We're at that beef-sashimi place
in front of the hospital."

00:41:22.007 --> 00:41:24.143
Fine! I'm jealous!

00:41:24.143 --> 00:41:25.644
I'm insanely jealous.

00:41:26.845 --> 00:41:29.481
I'm not some impressive professional
like that woman.

00:41:29.481 --> 00:41:31.550
I haven't even been seeing you that long.

00:41:32.484 --> 00:41:34.520
I know I'm being pathetic.

00:41:40.192 --> 00:41:43.062
How can you be so cute?

00:41:43.062 --> 00:41:44.763
I want to carry you around in my pocket.

00:41:44.763 --> 00:41:47.433
What are you doing?
I'm not in a good mood.

00:41:50.436 --> 00:41:53.038
Hey, that's a confession.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.841
A confession that you like me.

00:41:59.111 --> 00:42:01.313
Thanks, Il Ri, for being jealous.

00:42:02.681 --> 00:42:06.085
Until now, I thought
I was the only one who liked you.

00:42:06.085 --> 00:42:08.988
I thought you didn't really feel the same,
so I was anxious.

00:42:11.757 --> 00:42:13.525
I promise you.

00:42:14.226 --> 00:42:15.928
From now on, I will never...

00:42:16.695 --> 00:42:18.030
make you jealous again.

00:42:19.531 --> 00:42:20.566
Promise.

00:42:20.566 --> 00:42:22.234
That's enough.

00:42:22.234 --> 00:42:23.936
Go away.

00:42:23.936 --> 00:42:26.405
Why are you sitting next to me
and annoying me?

00:42:26.405 --> 00:42:27.940
- Hey, that hurts.
- Go away.

00:42:28.807 --> 00:42:29.642
Go away.

00:42:32.244 --> 00:42:33.045
Let's have a drink.

00:42:34.313 --> 00:42:35.147
Here.

00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:38.317
A cross-arm shot?

00:42:45.024 --> 00:42:45.958
Hey.

00:42:47.459 --> 00:42:49.261
What's this rumor
everyone's whispering about?

00:42:50.129 --> 00:42:51.063
What rumor?

00:42:51.063 --> 00:42:53.832
People are gossiping like crazy.

00:42:53.832 --> 00:42:57.136
You said your husband filed a report
against the division head.

00:42:57.136 --> 00:42:58.203
But why are they saying...

00:42:58.203 --> 00:43:00.539
he did it to cover up his own cheating?

00:43:00.539 --> 00:43:01.540
What's with that?

00:43:06.578 --> 00:43:07.513
What?

00:43:09.214 --> 00:43:11.483
Those people are trash.

00:43:11.817 --> 00:43:13.252
How could they manipulate a victim...

00:43:13.252 --> 00:43:15.354
and frame someone else?

00:43:15.354 --> 00:43:16.322
Song Ye Na should...

00:43:17.423 --> 00:43:18.324
Wait!

00:43:19.792 --> 00:43:20.793
What if...

00:43:21.126 --> 00:43:23.162
she just fell
for the executive director's offer...

00:43:23.162 --> 00:43:24.697
of the primetime segment?

00:43:25.331 --> 00:43:26.565
What are you talking about?

00:43:26.565 --> 00:43:30.169
I noticed something weird
when I looked at the lineup this morning.

00:43:30.169 --> 00:43:31.470
Song Ye Na was listed...

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:34.239
as the main primetime show host.

00:43:34.239 --> 00:43:37.376
So I was wondering...

00:43:37.376 --> 00:43:39.044
how she landed that spot.

00:43:39.311 --> 00:43:40.179
Really?

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.314
I'll show you.

00:43:45.618 --> 00:43:46.819
Look.

How do I clear this false accusation?

00:44:01.767 --> 00:44:02.701
Wait.

00:44:03.335 --> 00:44:04.236
What?

00:44:05.371 --> 00:44:06.438
You know that saying.

00:44:07.172 --> 00:44:09.908
"There may be men who never cheat,
but none who cheat just once."

00:44:09.908 --> 00:44:12.611
Guys who chase women like that...

00:44:12.611 --> 00:44:14.079
never change their habits.

00:44:14.813 --> 00:44:15.681
So,

00:44:16.282 --> 00:44:18.517
there may be more than two victims.

00:44:20.986 --> 00:44:22.021
You're right.

00:44:26.892 --> 00:44:28.928
Hey, Seon Young, it's me.

00:44:29.128 --> 00:44:30.696
Are you free with Min Ju?

00:44:31.163 --> 00:44:32.965
We heard the rumors too...

00:44:32.965 --> 00:44:35.234
and were so shocked.

00:44:35.234 --> 00:44:36.435
We had no idea.

00:44:36.435 --> 00:44:39.471
We just thought there was an affair
between Seon Min and Producer Noh.

00:44:39.805 --> 00:44:42.341
So to clear Producer Noh's name,

00:44:42.341 --> 00:44:44.276
we need solid evidence
against the division head.

00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:48.614
Have you ever seen him
hit on another female employee...

00:44:48.614 --> 00:44:51.116
or heard any rumors?
Anything at all?

00:44:51.684 --> 00:44:53.485
Even something that just passed by?

00:44:54.386 --> 00:44:55.387
Well...

00:44:57.456 --> 00:44:58.357
Right.

00:44:58.357 --> 00:45:02.227
Back when the division head
was in the business support team,

00:45:02.227 --> 00:45:04.296
there was an intern or junior employee...

00:45:04.296 --> 00:45:06.465
who quit only after three months.

00:45:06.665 --> 00:45:07.499
Really?

00:45:07.499 --> 00:45:11.303
She just stopped showing up without even
submitting a resignation letter,

00:45:11.303 --> 00:45:13.005
and everyone tore her apart for it.

00:45:14.206 --> 00:45:15.341
Maybe...

00:45:15.341 --> 00:45:16.308
Goodness.

00:45:17.276 --> 00:45:18.544
That could be it.

00:45:28.087 --> 00:45:30.255
You stayed close
with the business support team...

00:45:30.255 --> 00:45:32.725
since you kept working with them, right?

00:45:33.392 --> 00:45:35.995
I know it's a lot to ask,
but could you maybe get her number?

00:45:37.196 --> 00:45:38.964
I'm desperate.

00:45:39.565 --> 00:45:40.633
You know me, Tae Jeong.

00:45:42.067 --> 00:45:42.935
Okay, I'll try.

00:45:42.935 --> 00:45:45.638
But please don't ever say
that I looked into it for you.

00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:46.872
I promise.

00:45:50.976 --> 00:45:54.046
Assistant Manager Cha, it's me.

00:45:54.046 --> 00:45:57.283
You know, among the interns who joined
the business support team before,

00:45:57.283 --> 00:45:59.985
there was that woman
who left after three months, right?

00:45:59.985 --> 00:46:03.389
Yeah, Kim Bit Na.
Could you get me her number?

00:46:04.757 --> 00:46:05.691
Why?

00:46:05.691 --> 00:46:09.061
I remember she had a reputation
for being really good at her job,

00:46:09.061 --> 00:46:10.963
and a friend of mine
urgently needs a part-timer, that's why.

00:46:14.033 --> 00:46:15.467
I see.

00:46:16.869 --> 00:46:19.071
Okay, got it.

00:46:20.639 --> 00:46:21.507
Why?

00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:24.643
That woman...

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:27.246
left the company
and immediately went abroad to study.

00:46:28.847 --> 00:46:30.249
I see.

00:46:35.321 --> 00:46:36.455
What?

00:46:36.455 --> 00:46:39.024
I felt uneasy
that someone asked for her number,

00:46:39.024 --> 00:46:40.392
so I'm reporting it to you,
Executive Director.

00:46:41.093 --> 00:46:43.362
They said it was for a part-time job,

00:46:43.362 --> 00:46:44.897
but you never know.

00:46:44.897 --> 00:46:47.166
All right, thank you for letting me know.

00:47:04.049 --> 00:47:06.485
Hello, Executive Director Seo.
It's Kang.

00:47:06.485 --> 00:47:09.355
ChenChen is selling a package
identical to ours...

00:47:09.355 --> 00:47:11.223
at 189 dollars.

00:47:11.457 --> 00:47:13.826
Then all our orders
are going to get returned.

00:47:13.826 --> 00:47:15.594
Shouldn't we lower our price too?

00:47:16.128 --> 00:47:17.763
I see.

00:47:18.264 --> 00:47:19.031
Then...

00:47:21.567 --> 00:47:22.601
CEO Kang.

00:47:23.168 --> 00:47:26.538
You didn't tell that to anyone else
besides me yet, right?

00:47:27.106 --> 00:47:28.340
No, why?

00:47:29.408 --> 00:47:30.442
Then...

00:47:31.443 --> 00:47:34.546
could you help me out just this once?

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:53.232
Your order is ready.

00:47:59.305 --> 00:48:00.139
Thank you.

00:48:05.244 --> 00:48:07.513
What's this? I said no syrup,

00:48:07.513 --> 00:48:10.082
and you bought cake?
I'll gain weight that way.

00:48:10.082 --> 00:48:11.183
What did I tell you?

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:13.986
You're too skinny.
You need to put some weight on.

00:48:14.253 --> 00:48:16.422
You look like you'd fly away
if the wind blows.

00:48:16.422 --> 00:48:17.556
How am I supposed to relax?

00:48:17.556 --> 00:48:19.525
Seriously?

00:48:19.525 --> 00:48:20.759
Stop lying.

00:48:24.363 --> 00:48:26.699
Stop staring at me like that.

00:48:26.699 --> 00:48:28.667
I can't help it.

00:48:29.368 --> 00:48:33.138
Since when were you this beautiful?

00:48:34.673 --> 00:48:38.143
Stop it.
That phrase is so outdated.

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.214
Hey, look at that baby.

00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:44.650
So cute.

00:48:45.618 --> 00:48:48.487
She's so adorable.

00:48:48.487 --> 00:48:49.888
- How old is she?
- She's two.

00:48:51.123 --> 00:48:54.360
If you have such a cute baby,
you'd be full without eating.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.227
Right?

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:00.199
My goodness, she's like a little doll.

00:49:02.167 --> 00:49:04.803
(Seon Art Center)

00:49:20.986 --> 00:49:21.954
Those dolls...

00:49:23.522 --> 00:49:26.959
are not the weird dolls kind of dolls
you're imagining, ma'am.

00:49:28.827 --> 00:49:30.195
Those dolls,

00:49:31.463 --> 00:49:33.432
- when he was young...
- Mom, stop.

00:49:41.707 --> 00:49:43.575
(Psychiatry)

00:49:43.575 --> 00:49:45.110
We can't conclusively classify...

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:47.913
every such case as a paraphilia.

00:49:47.913 --> 00:49:51.417
If the person is unable to communicate
with actual people at all,

00:49:51.417 --> 00:49:53.552
we could call it objectophilia.

00:49:54.119 --> 00:49:55.621
But your husband got married,

00:49:56.121 --> 00:49:58.457
and you said you were intimate
with each other early in your marriage.

00:50:00.626 --> 00:50:01.493
Right.

00:50:03.195 --> 00:50:05.965
Then we should consider another angle.

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.935
Even ordinary people...

00:50:11.036 --> 00:50:14.073
lightly personify objects sometimes.

00:50:14.607 --> 00:50:17.910
Some people give nicknames to their cars.

00:50:18.544 --> 00:50:22.481
Musicians sometimes chat playfully...

00:50:22.481 --> 00:50:24.249
with their violins or cellos.

00:50:25.017 --> 00:50:25.918
Right.

00:50:27.853 --> 00:50:32.124
Has he ever mentioned
having been deeply hurt as a child,

00:50:32.625 --> 00:50:35.995
or any kind of trauma?

00:50:38.297 --> 00:50:39.231
I'm not sure.

00:50:43.736 --> 00:50:45.404
Okay, let's check one last thing.

00:50:45.404 --> 00:50:47.506
Shiz Elegance,
aluminum purity 99 percent,

00:50:47.506 --> 00:50:48.974
five-piece frying pan set.

00:50:48.974 --> 00:50:50.609
The price is 199 dollars.

00:50:50.609 --> 00:50:51.944
Give me the selling points.

00:50:51.944 --> 00:50:54.113
It's not a consumable but a collectible.

00:50:54.113 --> 00:50:56.115
It has the same performance
as a cast-iron pan.

00:50:56.115 --> 00:50:58.450
With the Prisma process,
its heat conductivity is high,

00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:00.719
and it doesn't stick.

00:51:00.719 --> 00:51:02.121
Okay, good.

00:51:02.121 --> 00:51:03.489
Also, don't forget the free gift.

00:51:03.489 --> 00:51:06.425
A steamer-combo stock pot
that fits 15 chickens.

00:51:07.059 --> 00:51:09.295
- Yes.
- All right, let's all do our best!

00:51:09.295 --> 00:51:10.462
Yes.

00:51:11.397 --> 00:51:12.698
- Good luck, everyone.
- Yes.

00:51:17.269 --> 00:51:19.972
Mr. Kang,
is there no attending staff today?

00:51:19.972 --> 00:51:20.806
Producer Noh.

00:51:21.573 --> 00:51:24.310
I just got information on ChenChen.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.112
They're selling a package
identical to ours for 189 dollars.

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:28.781
What?

00:51:28.781 --> 00:51:31.050
Then all our orders
are going to get returned.

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:33.986
I already got
Executive Director Seo's confirmation.

00:51:33.986 --> 00:51:36.055
Let's drop ours to 179 dollars.

00:51:36.689 --> 00:51:38.857
Wouldn't that be too much
of a risk for you?

00:51:38.857 --> 00:51:40.059
What can we do?

00:51:40.059 --> 00:51:42.461
It's better than getting everything
returned and piled up in storage.

00:51:43.929 --> 00:51:47.366
Even so,
proceeding like that sounds dangerous.

00:51:47.366 --> 00:51:49.301
Let me check with Executive Director Seo
and Merchandiser Choi...

00:51:49.301 --> 00:51:50.703
and call you back.

00:51:50.703 --> 00:51:51.604
Fine, then.

00:51:51.604 --> 00:51:52.471
Okay.

00:51:54.106 --> 00:51:56.976
(Executive Director Seo Gyeong Seon)

00:51:59.745 --> 00:52:02.615
The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail...

00:52:04.183 --> 00:52:07.286
(Merchandiser Choi Jeong Rae)

00:52:08.754 --> 00:52:11.023
The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Connecting...

00:52:11.023 --> 00:52:11.924
What?

00:52:19.999 --> 00:52:21.133
Hey, did you check?

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.970
Mr. Kang, Executive Director Seo
and Merchandiser Choi aren't answering.

00:52:25.271 --> 00:52:27.406
I'll try to find the Executive Director
and confirm...

00:52:27.406 --> 00:52:28.707
What are you talking about?

00:52:28.707 --> 00:52:31.844
The broadcast starts in five minutes.
What are you trying to confirm?

00:52:32.111 --> 00:52:34.346
I told you I already spoke
with Executive Director Seo.

00:52:34.346 --> 00:52:35.481
Why are you doubting everything?

00:52:36.215 --> 00:52:38.350
Producer Noh, what are you doing?
Aren't you coming in?

00:52:38.984 --> 00:52:39.818
Just a moment, Mr. Kang.

00:52:40.452 --> 00:52:42.388
Hyeon Gi, call Merchandiser Choi.

00:52:42.388 --> 00:52:43.422
If he answers, put him through to me.

00:52:45.524 --> 00:52:46.558
Yes, Mr. Kang.

00:52:46.558 --> 00:52:50.562
When exactly did you speak
with Executive Director Seo?

00:52:50.562 --> 00:52:52.598
I talked to her face-to-face
just a moment ago.

00:52:53.332 --> 00:52:54.266
He's not answering.

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:56.535
Producer, you need to come in now.

00:52:56.869 --> 00:52:58.337
Three minutes to broadcast.

00:53:01.206 --> 00:53:03.575
Mr. Kang, you're sure, right?

00:53:03.943 --> 00:53:05.878
Executive Director Seo approved it, right?

00:53:05.878 --> 00:53:07.012
She approved it.

00:53:07.012 --> 00:53:08.547
Why are you so doubtful?

00:53:09.148 --> 00:53:11.350
Okay, then. I'll adjust the price.

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:14.019
Please explain the situation
to Executive Director Seo later.

00:53:14.186 --> 00:53:15.020
Yes.

00:53:16.422 --> 00:53:18.724
Hyeon Gi, I'll go to the sub control room
and let them know.

00:53:18.724 --> 00:53:19.858
You go tell the show hosts...

00:53:19.858 --> 00:53:21.860
that the price
is being changed to 179 dollars.

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.330
And during the broadcast,
keep calling Merchandiser Choi...

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:25.864
and ask him to negotiate later
with CEO Kang.

00:53:26.098 --> 00:53:27.499
- Yes, got it.
- Go.

00:53:32.237 --> 00:53:33.105
Thank you.

The 5,000 sets we prepared
for the third batch...

00:53:35.841 --> 00:53:37.977
have all sold out.

00:53:37.977 --> 00:53:40.479
If you missed it, don't worry.

00:53:40.479 --> 00:53:44.083

with even better deals.

00:53:53.392 --> 00:53:54.259
Cut!

00:53:54.994 --> 00:53:57.162
- Great job.
- Thank you.

00:53:57.596 --> 00:53:58.664
- Good work.
- Yes.

00:54:00.899 --> 00:54:02.501
Thank you.

00:54:02.501 --> 00:54:03.369
Yes.

00:54:04.903 --> 00:54:07.373
Thank you both so much.

00:54:07.373 --> 00:54:08.641
It was sudden,

00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:10.542
but you didn't panic and handled it well.

00:54:11.277 --> 00:54:12.778
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:54:14.413 --> 00:54:15.848
- Let's go eat.
- Yeah, let's go.

00:54:16.415 --> 00:54:17.716
- Hold on.
- Okay.

00:54:17.716 --> 00:54:18.717
Yes, Executive Director.

00:54:18.717 --> 00:54:19.852
What was that?

00:54:19.852 --> 00:54:21.820
Why did you lower the price on your own
during the broadcast?

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:22.655
What?

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:25.824
What do you mean?

00:54:26.325 --> 00:54:28.160
Didn't you approve it, Executive Director?

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.028
Me?

00:54:31.764 --> 00:54:33.933
Mr. Kang said you approved it,

00:54:33.933 --> 00:54:35.467
and told us to adjust the price.

00:54:35.467 --> 00:54:37.703
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:54:37.703 --> 00:54:39.571
When did I approve anything?

00:54:45.277 --> 00:54:46.145
Me?

00:54:46.578 --> 00:54:47.479
When have I ever?

00:54:48.347 --> 00:54:50.716
You clearly told me...

00:54:50.983 --> 00:54:53.652
that Executive Director Seo approved it
and to lower the price.

00:54:53.652 --> 00:54:54.887
What are you talking about?

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:57.623
I asked you
if you checked the competitor prices,

00:54:58.324 --> 00:54:59.258
and you said yes.

00:54:59.258 --> 00:55:01.860
It's you who's talking nonsense.

00:55:02.127 --> 00:55:05.197
You told me you met Executive Director Seo
face-to-face and got her approval.

00:55:05.197 --> 00:55:07.433
You clearly told me that.

00:55:07.433 --> 00:55:10.636
When I said
this broadcast absolutely can't fail,

00:55:10.636 --> 00:55:13.038
you snapped, asking if I didn't trust you.

00:55:13.472 --> 00:55:16.475
You told me not to bother you
because you already confirmed it!

00:55:16.475 --> 00:55:18.177
When did I ever say that, Mr. Kang?

00:55:18.644 --> 00:55:20.479
Why do you keep saying things
that never happened?

00:55:20.479 --> 00:55:21.847
Seriously?

00:55:21.847 --> 00:55:24.516
Hyeon Gi, what do you think?

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:26.218
Is Producer Noh telling the truth?

00:55:26.518 --> 00:55:27.686
How much did you hear?

00:55:28.754 --> 00:55:31.757
Well, I didn't hear it clearly.

00:55:31.757 --> 00:55:34.994
What? You heard me on the phone
the whole time.

00:55:35.594 --> 00:55:38.631
I was busy preparing for the broadcast,
so I didn't hear it properly.

00:55:38.964 --> 00:55:40.699
So I can't say for sure.

00:55:40.699 --> 00:55:43.068
Hyeon Gi, why are you being like that too?

00:55:43.602 --> 00:55:46.338
Is there anyone here who heard anything?

00:55:47.106 --> 00:55:48.107
I can't even.

00:55:48.907 --> 00:55:51.477
Why are you shifting the blame onto me?

00:55:51.477 --> 00:55:53.712
Do you even know how much we lost?

00:55:53.712 --> 00:55:55.214
A whole 100,000 dollars.

00:55:56.215 --> 00:55:57.116
Pay up, right now.

00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.118
Pay 100,000 dollars.

00:55:59.118 --> 00:56:01.020
- I said pay up, you bastard.
- Please calm down.

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.955
Why are you doing this to me?

00:56:03.722 --> 00:56:05.257
Why are you trying to pin
this false charge on me?

00:56:05.257 --> 00:56:07.026
What grudge do you have against me?

00:56:08.227 --> 00:56:09.028
Mr. Kang.

00:56:09.028 --> 00:56:10.029
Seriously?

00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:12.798
- He just hit me.
- Are you okay?

00:56:12.798 --> 00:56:15.134
A measly producer...

00:56:15.134 --> 00:56:17.636
assaulting the CEO of a partner company?

00:56:17.636 --> 00:56:19.071
- Calm down.
- Unbelievable.

00:56:19.805 --> 00:56:21.040
Don't do that.

00:56:29.348 --> 00:56:30.683
How are you planning
to take responsibility?

00:56:32.017 --> 00:56:33.986
We already took a huge loss,

00:56:34.353 --> 00:56:36.055
and you even assaulted
the CEO of a partner company?

00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:38.724
You know this could blow up...

00:56:38.724 --> 00:56:40.492
into a power-abuse scandal, right?

00:56:41.193 --> 00:56:42.294
It wasn't assault.

00:56:43.462 --> 00:56:45.230
Mr. Kang grabbed my collar first.

00:56:45.664 --> 00:56:47.066
You saw it too, Executive Director.

00:56:47.066 --> 00:56:49.835
Who grabbed who first isn't the point.

00:56:50.336 --> 00:56:52.571
The issue is
that a home shopping producer...

00:56:52.571 --> 00:56:54.673
handled a partner company's CEO like that.

00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:59.278
And more importantly,
because of your mistake,

00:56:59.278 --> 00:57:01.480
we've taken over 100,000 dollars
in financial damage.

00:57:03.148 --> 00:57:05.584
This isn't something I can cover for you.

00:57:05.584 --> 00:57:06.885
It wasn't my mistake.

00:57:06.885 --> 00:57:08.821
Mr. Kang lied to me.

00:57:10.089 --> 00:57:11.657
I don't know why he would...

00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:17.930
Wait.

00:57:19.965 --> 00:57:21.567
Did you order this, Executive Director?

00:57:23.836 --> 00:57:24.803
What are you talking about?

00:57:25.004 --> 00:57:27.273
Because I reported the division head
to the ethics committee,

00:57:28.841 --> 00:57:30.676
did you set up this trap on purpose?

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:34.546
So now you're suspecting me too?

00:57:34.546 --> 00:57:35.481
Isn't it true?

00:57:36.548 --> 00:57:38.450
You're trying to frame me
so you can kick me out.

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:39.218
Isn't that it?

00:57:40.986 --> 00:57:43.222
Drag this man out of my office.

00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:46.058
What are you doing?

00:57:47.293 --> 00:57:49.161
Executive Director, what are you doing?

00:57:49.161 --> 00:57:50.930
What do you think you're doing right now?

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:52.398
You need to answer my question.

00:57:53.332 --> 00:57:54.133
Executive Director.

00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.068
Executive Director.

00:57:56.068 --> 00:57:57.903
How can you handle things like this?

00:57:58.103 --> 00:57:59.738
Let go of me.
Executive Director!

00:58:00.306 --> 00:58:01.173
Executive Director!

00:58:50.489 --> 00:58:52.091
No childhood photos here.

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.561
Are they at his parents' house?

00:59:32.031 --> 00:59:34.099
Hi, guys.

00:59:35.868 --> 00:59:36.969
Have you been well?

01:00:09.535 --> 01:00:10.369
About that day,

01:00:12.738 --> 01:00:14.873
I'm really sorry...

01:00:16.742 --> 01:00:18.310
my mom acted so rudely.

01:00:19.678 --> 01:00:21.046
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

01:00:22.247 --> 01:00:24.450
I'm sorry I couldn't stop it.

01:00:26.118 --> 01:00:28.387
Who can stand up to your parents or mine?

01:00:32.358 --> 01:00:33.359
Now that I think about it,

01:00:34.893 --> 01:00:36.795
don't we have a lot in common?

01:00:39.131 --> 01:00:42.935
You, the perfect model student
who could never go against his parents.

01:00:43.469 --> 01:00:45.604
And me, the foolish model student...

01:00:46.238 --> 01:00:47.606
who never talked back to my mom.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.375
Model students like that...

01:00:50.476 --> 01:00:52.378
can't even divorce easily.

01:00:54.647 --> 01:00:55.514
That day,

01:00:57.383 --> 01:00:59.385
for the first time in my life,

01:01:00.986 --> 01:01:03.622
I talked back to my mom
and told her to stop meddling in my life.

01:01:04.923 --> 01:01:06.392
I used to think
the world would collapse...

01:01:06.392 --> 01:01:08.294
if I disobeyed her.

01:01:08.627 --> 01:01:09.728
But guess what.

01:01:10.996 --> 01:01:12.498
I actually felt relieved.

01:01:13.866 --> 01:01:15.234
Only then did I realize...

01:01:16.735 --> 01:01:17.569
that...

01:01:19.338 --> 01:01:21.073
even after marrying you,

01:01:21.607 --> 01:01:23.809
I was still just my mom's eldest daughter,

01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:25.844
never truly your wife.

01:01:27.846 --> 01:01:28.781
All those times...

01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:32.751
I pushed you...

01:01:33.352 --> 01:01:35.621
about having a child.

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:39.258
I'm sorry.

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:46.699
Why did I want a baby so badly?

01:01:48.434 --> 01:01:52.237
I thought a lot about whether
I really wanted a child, and I realized...

01:01:52.938 --> 01:01:55.908
I just wanted to be the good daughter
who gives her mom a grandchild,

01:01:57.376 --> 01:02:00.546
and the good daughter-in-law
who gains her mother-in-law's approval.

01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:04.817
I don't think I genuinely wanted a baby.

01:02:07.319 --> 01:02:09.788
That awful people-pleasing tendency...

01:02:11.657 --> 01:02:14.960
was eating away at both our lives.

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:19.298
But...

01:02:20.499 --> 01:02:22.134
I have one question.

01:02:23.802 --> 01:02:24.903
What is it?

01:02:25.671 --> 01:02:27.573
What was your mother trying to say...

01:02:29.041 --> 01:02:30.309
that day?

01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:33.912
Can you tell me?

01:02:46.492 --> 01:02:48.627
(Noh Won Bin
This person is hereby disciplined...)

01:02:48.627 --> 01:02:51.363
(for serious financial damage caused
by negligent work performance.)

01:02:56.101 --> 01:02:57.703
(Noh Won Bin)

01:02:57.703 --> 01:03:00.873
(Home Shopping
Daegu Logistics Center Management)

01:03:08.814 --> 01:03:09.915
I'm sorry, Na Jeong.

01:03:10.849 --> 01:03:13.652
I was too stupid to notice
such an obvious trap.

01:03:18.457 --> 01:03:19.525
It's all my fault.

01:03:21.627 --> 01:03:22.828
Because I'm incompetent.

01:03:24.096 --> 01:03:25.598
Because I'm foolish.

01:03:27.366 --> 01:03:28.367
Hold your head up.

01:03:29.902 --> 01:03:32.471
Don't talk weak, and hold your head up.

01:03:35.741 --> 01:03:38.010
This isn't your fault.

01:03:38.377 --> 01:03:41.013
You're not incompetent.
You're not foolish.

01:03:42.047 --> 01:03:43.449
They're the wicked ones.

01:03:44.249 --> 01:03:46.251
We didn't do anything wrong.

01:03:47.886 --> 01:03:50.623
Why are you collapsing like this
without even fighting?

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:55.761
Listen carefully.

01:03:56.929 --> 01:03:59.632
No matter what happens,
I will clear your name.

01:04:00.899 --> 01:04:03.068
I'll make every one of them pay.

01:04:04.169 --> 01:04:07.473
So stop talking weak
and get ready to fight properly.

01:04:08.941 --> 01:04:09.808
Got it?

01:05:46.772 --> 01:05:48.874
(Don't call me ma'am)

01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:50.676
Don't worry about us. Good luck.

01:05:51.477 --> 01:05:53.178
I need to talk to the CEO about this.

01:05:53.178 --> 01:05:55.147
I'll fix it one way or another.

01:05:55.147 --> 01:05:57.983
Why not fire him
instead of just demoting him?

01:05:57.983 --> 01:05:59.818
So I'm supposed to handle...

01:05:59.818 --> 01:06:01.387
all the late-night and dawn shows?

01:06:01.387 --> 01:06:02.688
If you can't handle it,

01:06:02.688 --> 01:06:04.189
stop being stubborn and leave.

01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:07.092
You know what that doll means,
don't you, Mother?

01:06:07.092 --> 01:06:08.460
- Mom.
- Come here!

01:06:08.794 --> 01:06:10.996
Joo Young, I'm sorry.

01:06:11.897 --> 01:06:13.198
So if we get married,

01:06:14.033 --> 01:06:15.834
do you want to have a baby?

01:06:15.834 --> 01:06:16.802
Of course.

01:06:16.802 --> 01:06:18.904
I'd love to have a daughter
who looks just like you.

01:06:19.605 --> 01:06:20.472
It's okay.

01:06:20.472 --> 01:06:21.874
Why are you pushing me away?

01:06:21.874 --> 01:06:23.542
After taking all the benefits?

01:06:23.542 --> 01:06:24.843
Ye Na, we should talk.

01:06:25.878 --> 01:06:27.379
Should we talk in front of people?

01:06:28.013 --> 01:06:28.881
Is that okay?

01:06:30.916 --> 01:06:32.918
