HEROES NEXT DOOR

00:00:41.897 --> 00:00:43.065
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ALL CHARACTERS, PROFESSIONS, PLACES,

00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:44.149
COMPANIES, ORGANIZATIONS,
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVENTS ARE NOT REAL.

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:45.150
ALL CHILD AND ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
SAFELY UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION.

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:49.529
SEPTEMBER 18, 2022

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:02.000
Oh, my goodness!

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:11.843
Dad, I'm screwed.

00:01:12.386 --> 00:01:15.055
What are you talking about, U-seong?

00:01:15.514 --> 00:01:17.349
I don't know. I might've hit someone.

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:19.226
Just help me!

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.902
Hello, a child got run over!

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:30.195
Please come quickly!

00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:38.203
There's been an accident.
Please come here right now!

00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:40.497
Please help!

00:01:57.806 --> 00:01:59.474
Hey, have a seat.

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.855
It must be something urgent.

00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:07.107
You never come here.

00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:11.403
You know Kwon Sang-tae's son,
U-seong, right?

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.906
Yeah, he must be done
with his military service soon.

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:18.660
He got drunk as soon as he got discharged
and hit someone with his car.

00:02:19.453 --> 00:02:20.829
And it's Sullivan's daughter.

00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:22.414
Oh, my.

00:02:23.123 --> 00:02:24.124
Is she badly hurt?

00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:28.128
There hasn't been
an official announcement yet,

00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:31.214
but the doctor said there was no hope.

00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:34.634
So he killed someone while drunk-driving?

00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:38.805
You know Kwon Sang-tae
is expected to be the next Speaker, right?

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.226
He says he'll help us
designate Kiyun-si as a specialized zone

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.770
if we help him.

00:02:44.853 --> 00:02:46.062
Is there anything we can do?

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:50.108
There is.

00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:51.109
There is?

00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:56.364
If he was discharged today,
he's still technically a soldier.

00:02:56.448 --> 00:02:59.659
Just say he was on duty,
then he'll be tried in the military court.

00:02:59.743 --> 00:03:02.120
Then he could get away with it.

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:05.707
Oh, right.

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:09.252
But the appeal trial
would be in a civilian court.

00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:10.879
I'll take care of it then.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:12.214
Will you?

00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:14.174
Oh, goodness.

00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:19.054
But aren't you and Sullivan
business partners?

00:03:19.137 --> 00:03:20.722
Come on.

00:03:21.556 --> 00:03:24.017
My private life
should stay separate from work.

00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:26.770
Sullivan is work,

00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:28.605
while the future Speaker is private.

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.232
You get me?

00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:31.233
Gosh!

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.907
PRESENT, 2025

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.408
KANG JUNG-GI

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:44.287
Hey.

00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:45.705
Seok-jun.

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:46.832
It was Sullivan.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:49.751
What is?

00:03:50.544 --> 00:03:53.338
The one who paid double for our bombs.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.841
What?

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:10.063
HEROES NEXT DOOR PART 2

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:20.365
He's the Minister of National Defense?

00:04:21.783 --> 00:04:22.659
Yeah.

00:04:23.493 --> 00:04:26.913
So we caught the Minister red-handed.

00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:28.999
- Then I was right about him before.
- Yeah.

00:04:29.082 --> 00:04:32.752
How corrupt does a Minister have to be
to abduct a civilian?

00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:35.088
This is definitely illegal.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.798
I'm sure he'll be arrested.

00:04:36.923 --> 00:04:38.842
It's good if that's the case,

00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:40.802
but I didn't expect it to go up this high.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.179
Can we still tap in on them?

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.181
No, it got disconnected.

00:04:45.265 --> 00:04:46.808
They seem to have found the bug.

00:04:48.768 --> 00:04:49.811
I'll upload the video.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.565
I'll report this
to the Vice Minister first.

00:04:53.857 --> 00:04:55.317
I'll tell him.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.902
I have to talk to him anyway.

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:58.945
I'll do it.

00:05:06.828 --> 00:05:08.580
How did they know to come here?

00:05:09.414 --> 00:05:11.666
It seems that they tracked our location.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.668
I found this on the wall.

00:05:15.253 --> 00:05:16.129
What's this?

00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:20.759
They tapped us?

00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:26.514
Anything they took?

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.350
Well...

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:29.684
What now?

00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:31.811
They took every button from our uniforms.

00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:34.356
Buttons?

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:36.524
What? Like this?

00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:40.153
So should we drag them all in?

00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:41.112
You idiot.

00:05:41.196 --> 00:05:43.365
There's been too much exposure.

00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:47.577
Get rid of all the evidence
and empty this place.

00:05:47.661 --> 00:05:50.997
We need to figure out what they've stolen
to decide what to do.

00:05:51.957 --> 00:05:53.583
Do you ever use your head?

00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:56.544
What's the point of having one that big?

00:05:56.628 --> 00:05:58.046
So we just let them be?

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:59.506
Who said we're letting them be?

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:02.217
We can't let them be.

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:12.394
Good work.

00:06:13.061 --> 00:06:14.479
We'll start investigating immediately.

00:06:14.813 --> 00:06:17.399
Did you really not know
the Minister took Producer Kim?

00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:21.695
Or did you approach me on purpose,
knowing everything?

00:06:23.154 --> 00:06:27.117
I had a feeling it had to do
with corruption in the defense industry,

00:06:27.742 --> 00:06:29.619
but I didn't expect civilian abduction.

00:06:30.286 --> 00:06:31.955
And that corruption

00:06:32.497 --> 00:06:35.000
has something to do with
the explosions in our town?

00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:37.460
That's what we're investigating.

00:06:39.713 --> 00:06:41.715
If you're just using me...

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.175
I assure you, no.

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:45.802
I'll hand this over to Internal Affairs.

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:49.180
I'll let you know if we find anything.

00:07:10.535 --> 00:07:11.369
Honey.

00:07:22.172 --> 00:07:23.423
I'm fine.

00:07:30.597 --> 00:07:31.431
And Do-yeon?

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.852
She insisted on waiting for you,
but fell asleep just now.

00:07:36.811 --> 00:07:38.188
How did it go?

00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:39.606
Is everything good now?

00:07:41.524 --> 00:07:44.069
- I can explain--
- Forget it.

00:07:44.152 --> 00:07:45.945
Whatever it is,

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:49.032
just don't let it
get to Do-yeon or me, okay?

00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:54.579
Yes, ma'am.

00:07:58.166 --> 00:07:59.542
Oh, right.

00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:01.878
Guess who we ran into on our way home?

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.421
Who?

00:08:03.505 --> 00:08:04.380
Sullivan.

00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:05.799
Who?

00:08:05.882 --> 00:08:07.008
James Sullivan.

00:08:07.092 --> 00:08:11.805
I guess it really was Sullivan
who gave Do-yeon the ice cream last time.

00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:15.391
Did he say anything?

00:08:15.475 --> 00:08:17.644
No, he just said hi to Do-yeon and left.

00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:20.688
He seems to be
looking around the neighborhood.

00:08:24.234 --> 00:08:25.110
What is it?

00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:28.196
It's nothing. Let's head in.

00:08:28.613 --> 00:08:29.447
Okay.

00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:40.416
The call cannot be completed.
Please leave a voice message...

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.751
JAMES SULLIVAN

00:08:41.835 --> 00:08:45.839
This bastard keeps ignoring my calls.

00:08:53.847 --> 00:08:54.806
Hey.

00:08:56.099 --> 00:08:58.726
Minister Kim, you'll need to come with us.

00:09:10.697 --> 00:09:12.407
I told you to leave no trace

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.994
of anyone and anything
related to the bombs.

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:18.746
Apologies, sir. I'll take care of it.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.291
Take care of what? Huh?

00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:23.418
What can you even do?

00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:29.048
How dare you question me

00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:32.510
over such a ridiculous, doctored video?

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.054
Did you guys even confirm
that this wasn't fake?

00:09:35.513 --> 00:09:37.307
You have to be sure.

00:09:37.557 --> 00:09:38.933
It's either you guys or me.

00:09:39.809 --> 00:09:42.020
One side is going to die from this.

00:09:42.645 --> 00:09:43.563
You realize that?

00:09:44.397 --> 00:09:46.191
This is just a procedural investigation.

00:09:47.233 --> 00:09:49.110
You must explain this
to return to your job.

00:09:49.194 --> 00:09:50.570
Explain what?

00:09:51.863 --> 00:09:54.490
What's there to explain?

00:09:55.617 --> 00:09:57.994
I did nothing wrong.

00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:05.960
I'll take it from here.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.230
Who are you teaming up with
to screw me over?

00:10:25.772 --> 00:10:27.398
What do you mean?

00:10:28.066 --> 00:10:31.027
Where could you have gotten that?

00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:34.489
Someone reported it.

00:10:34.948 --> 00:10:36.866
I can't tell you who.

00:10:42.497 --> 00:10:45.250
I was wondering how those bastards
had the nerve to do this.

00:10:46.084 --> 00:10:47.835
So you were behind it.

00:10:49.462 --> 00:10:50.505
Come here.

00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:55.134
Fine.

00:10:58.096 --> 00:11:01.641
You thick-headed moron.

00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:04.269
Do you realize what you're doing?

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:08.606
I've set this up to find the bastards
who snuck away the bombs,

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.026
and you're ruining my plan.

00:11:12.902 --> 00:11:14.279
Think about it.

00:11:14.988 --> 00:11:16.990
You think the Minister of National Defense

00:11:17.073 --> 00:11:20.618
would sneak away some bombs
for pocket money?

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.965
Hello.

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:52.900
Bye!

00:11:54.193 --> 00:11:55.486
- Bye.
- See you, Do-yeon.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.738
- See you later!
- See you.

00:12:32.273 --> 00:12:36.027
We're first going to sketch
what we want to make with the clay.

00:12:43.743 --> 00:12:45.119
Her name is Pinky.

00:13:01.427 --> 00:13:03.846
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.014
Oh, man.

00:13:06.432 --> 00:13:08.518
- Byeong-nam!
- Yeah?

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.354
Are you still in pain?
It's already been days.

00:13:11.437 --> 00:13:13.189
- I'm fine.
- Here.

00:13:13.564 --> 00:13:16.651
Here are some pain relief patches,
painkillers, and anti-inflammatory pills.

00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:18.444
- Wow, thanks.
- Of course.

00:13:18.528 --> 00:13:21.697
I saw how you couldn't fight back at all
when they beat you up.

00:13:22.865 --> 00:13:24.826
Beat me up?

00:13:25.201 --> 00:13:27.662
I ducked strategically
when they threw their--

00:13:28.413 --> 00:13:30.998
- Oh, gosh.
- First,

00:13:31.082 --> 00:13:33.334
put on the pain relief patch.

00:13:33.418 --> 00:13:36.379
- Okay.
- And come to my gym.

00:13:36.504 --> 00:13:37.630
You can't just duck.

00:13:37.713 --> 00:13:39.715
You have to grab and flip them!

00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:42.135
Special martial arts! Kick!

00:13:42.218 --> 00:13:44.679
- These are the basics.
- My gosh.

00:13:44.762 --> 00:13:47.348
KIM SEOK-JUN

00:13:49.434 --> 00:13:52.979
It's been days and still no news update.

00:13:55.523 --> 00:13:58.109
Hey, these are for Changri Church
and the senior citizen center.

00:13:58.192 --> 00:13:59.277
The receipts are inside.

00:14:00.361 --> 00:14:02.280
How's your back doing?

00:14:05.908 --> 00:14:07.076
What about my back?

00:14:07.535 --> 00:14:09.620
You've been whimpering in your sleep.

00:14:09.704 --> 00:14:11.497
What are you even doing these days?

00:14:11.581 --> 00:14:14.542
Your pretty face is all scratched up, too.

00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:17.795
I told you I got hurt from
getting some boxes down.

00:14:19.422 --> 00:14:20.923
You expect me to believe that?

00:14:22.758 --> 00:14:25.344
I saw that someone
cleaned up the storage room.

00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:27.763
Was it you?

00:14:28.055 --> 00:14:30.975
I just cleaned it yesterday
because we got new supplies.

00:14:31.058 --> 00:14:31.976
Is it bad?

00:14:33.102 --> 00:14:34.520
You're so good with your hands.

00:14:34.854 --> 00:14:36.898
Nobody is as meticulous as you are.

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:43.738
If you're saying that, it must be true.

00:14:44.489 --> 00:14:45.490
I'll get going.

00:14:54.874 --> 00:14:56.209
Oh, my back.

00:15:10.932 --> 00:15:11.807
Hey.

00:15:12.475 --> 00:15:15.686
Hey, that's Mr. Thursday
coming down, right?

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.189
Yeah, the man of every second Thursday.

00:15:18.439 --> 00:15:19.815
Right on.

00:15:21.192 --> 00:15:22.360
Let's get to work.

00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:25.029
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:15:40.503 --> 00:15:43.130
What? That bus goes to my neighborhood.

00:15:43.589 --> 00:15:45.091
That place has a lot of alleys.

00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:47.134
Perfect for faking accidents.

00:15:47.927 --> 00:15:49.929
Is today the day, then?

00:15:50.846 --> 00:15:51.889
Probably.

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:26.799
Oh, no!

00:16:29.218 --> 00:16:30.845
Are you okay, sir?

00:16:30.928 --> 00:16:32.597
- Don't touch me.
- Okay, no touching.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.889
Gosh, I'm dying here.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.517
Give me a second. I'll call 911.

00:16:36.601 --> 00:16:39.937
- What's their number?
- I can see my dead parents.

00:16:40.021 --> 00:16:40.938
Father...

00:16:41.022 --> 00:16:43.316
Hello? Is this--

00:16:43.441 --> 00:16:44.859
Hello, never mind.

00:16:44.942 --> 00:16:46.027
Kang.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.987
Su-il, I got this.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:48.904
What?

00:16:49.572 --> 00:16:51.532
You can get up now.

00:16:52.074 --> 00:16:53.326
Who are you guys?

00:16:53.743 --> 00:16:55.786
Don't you remember me? We've met.

00:16:56.662 --> 00:16:59.206
You were driving
under the speed limit, right?

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.459
Yeah, probably, because it's an alley.

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:04.128
How do you know how fast he was going?

00:17:04.211 --> 00:17:06.756
The crash was so loud!

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:10.134
And there aren't any cameras around!

00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:11.761
Oh, my back.

00:17:12.845 --> 00:17:14.847
My ribs! Oh, no.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.099
Please call an ambulance for me.

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:22.813
Look at this, sir!

00:17:23.105 --> 00:17:26.859
He was going at 24km per hour
in a 30km zone.

00:17:26.942 --> 00:17:29.570
See? It says 30km right there!

00:17:29.654 --> 00:17:31.906
And actually, you were the one speeding.

00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:33.991
You bounced off too far.

00:17:34.075 --> 00:17:37.787
And why do you
only get into accidents on Thursdays?

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.830
We're busy on Thursdays!

00:17:39.914 --> 00:17:41.832
What are you talking about?

00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:46.003
I got hit by a car,
and now I'm about to die!

00:17:46.587 --> 00:17:50.925
We've been filming you
since before the crash.

00:17:51.384 --> 00:17:53.386
So is this an insurance fraud?

00:17:53.469 --> 00:17:54.970
- Yeah.
- Yeah, an insurance fraud.

00:17:55.054 --> 00:17:58.057
- Hey, no!
- Stop.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.601
- Unbelievable.
- Man...

00:18:00.726 --> 00:18:01.727
Sir,

00:18:01.811 --> 00:18:05.981
if you keep getting into accidents
on purpose for insurance money,

00:18:06.065 --> 00:18:09.568
you may be jailed for up to 5 years
or fined up to 20 million won.

00:18:09.652 --> 00:18:13.322
And under the Special Act
on the Prevention of Insurance Fraud,

00:18:13.406 --> 00:18:17.243
you may be jailed for up to 10 years
or fined for up to 50 million won.

00:18:19.245 --> 00:18:20.830
You guys are lucky today.

00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:23.666
Look at him walking.

00:18:23.749 --> 00:18:26.585
- Where are you going, sir?
- He's running now.

00:18:27.962 --> 00:18:30.297
Oh, right on time!

00:18:49.567 --> 00:18:50.943
Jeong-hwan is here.

00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:53.863
That's a nice engine sound.

00:19:01.996 --> 00:19:04.498
- You're pretty funny.
- Yes, I am.

00:19:08.586 --> 00:19:10.045
Hey, Yong-hui.

00:19:10.421 --> 00:19:12.506
Did you two go somewhere together?

00:19:13.215 --> 00:19:14.508
We met on the way.

00:19:14.592 --> 00:19:16.260
- Did you?
- I'll head in now.

00:19:18.012 --> 00:19:19.263
Wait for me.

00:19:27.938 --> 00:19:30.107
KIM SEOK-JUN

00:19:30.191 --> 00:19:31.859
How is there no news at all?

00:19:32.193 --> 00:19:33.402
I knew it.

00:19:36.197 --> 00:19:37.364
Hello.

00:19:37.448 --> 00:19:38.699
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:19:44.288 --> 00:19:46.874
Ms. Lee, any updates
from the Vice Minister?

00:19:47.124 --> 00:19:49.627
No, not yet.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.795
Ms. Lee.

00:19:51.504 --> 00:19:52.713
Why are you here, Jeong-hwan?

00:19:54.131 --> 00:19:57.009
I came to check for any updates,
but I guess there are none.

00:19:58.427 --> 00:20:01.388
Hey, my arm still hurts. Is this normal?

00:20:02.014 --> 00:20:04.433
You're pretty weak for such a young man.

00:20:04.517 --> 00:20:05.684
You should work out.

00:20:06.602 --> 00:20:09.355
Many of the Minister's men
are former Special Forces agents.

00:20:09.438 --> 00:20:10.856
They could kill you with a punch.

00:20:11.148 --> 00:20:11.982
Right?

00:20:12.274 --> 00:20:16.654
Ms. Lee, how come you only ever side
with Jeong-hwan?

00:20:17.696 --> 00:20:18.864
I never did that.

00:20:19.782 --> 00:20:21.158
She's never done that.

00:20:21.492 --> 00:20:24.119
Fine. Producer Kim, have you had lunch?

00:20:24.203 --> 00:20:25.371
I got some good food.

00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:29.750
What is it? It looks delicious.

00:20:30.084 --> 00:20:31.377
That's so much of it, too.

00:20:31.961 --> 00:20:33.128
Let's eat together.

00:20:33.838 --> 00:20:35.172
I already had lunch.

00:20:35.548 --> 00:20:36.715
Please excuse me.

00:20:37.716 --> 00:20:39.635
I also had a lot to eat. Excuse me.

00:20:42.763 --> 00:20:44.181
What's going on?

00:20:44.265 --> 00:20:46.016
Did they have lunch together?

00:20:47.226 --> 00:20:48.936
Give me that. It's not for you.

00:20:51.272 --> 00:20:52.398
I need to bring it back.

00:20:53.649 --> 00:20:56.402
HARDWARE DREAM TREE STATIONERY

CRITERIA FOR THE REWARD

00:21:05.077 --> 00:21:07.913
So what are the criteria?

00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:13.711
You need to outline what I need to report
to get more money.

00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:18.757
Hey. Sit here.

00:21:20.426 --> 00:21:22.678
You reek of pain relief patches.

00:21:23.012 --> 00:21:25.097
- Is it that bad?
- That bad?

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.682
Did you cover your whole body?

00:21:26.765 --> 00:21:27.892
How many do you have on?

00:21:27.975 --> 00:21:30.185
Not that many. Just three.

00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:31.562
Ridiculous.

00:21:31.979 --> 00:21:34.732
I must be getting old. I'm still sore.

00:21:35.566 --> 00:21:36.567
And you?

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.902
How are you doing?

00:21:37.985 --> 00:21:40.279
Look at this here.

00:21:40.863 --> 00:21:42.990
My pain relief patches
don't reek like yours.

00:21:43.073 --> 00:21:44.783
- For goodness' sake.
- That hurts.

00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:46.035
Good for you.

00:21:47.244 --> 00:21:49.538
I wonder if Mr. Choi is doing okay.

00:21:49.622 --> 00:21:51.790
He'll be fine. You saw him.

00:21:51.874 --> 00:21:52.708
Smack, smack!

00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:54.293
Oh, gosh.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:55.669
True.

00:21:56.462 --> 00:21:58.213
Take good care of him.

00:21:58.297 --> 00:22:00.257
You two seem like best friends.

00:22:01.508 --> 00:22:03.886
Hey, by the way,

00:22:03.969 --> 00:22:05.930
we sent the video ages ago.

00:22:06.013 --> 00:22:09.725
We should've seen something on the news
or gotten some reward money.

00:22:10.392 --> 00:22:12.102
Something should have happened by now.

00:22:12.186 --> 00:22:13.312
I know.

00:22:13.395 --> 00:22:14.980
That's exactly why I'm here.

00:22:15.314 --> 00:22:16.899
Did Mr. Choi tell you anything?

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.526
That'll be 500 won.

00:22:22.196 --> 00:22:23.530
Or just 300 won--

00:22:23.614 --> 00:22:25.824
No, no updates.

00:22:28.202 --> 00:22:29.203
Bye now.

00:22:30.329 --> 00:22:32.498
I caught Mr. Thursday red-handed,

00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:34.166
saved my neighbor,

00:22:34.249 --> 00:22:36.377
and got rid of your biggest nuisance.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.628
All three at once!

00:22:37.711 --> 00:22:39.338
That's who I am!

00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:42.007
I'm Veotigo's ace!

00:22:45.302 --> 00:22:46.553
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

00:22:46.637 --> 00:22:47.513
Good work.

00:22:47.596 --> 00:22:49.223
It's nothing.

00:22:50.641 --> 00:22:53.060
Why are you only praising him?
What about me?

00:22:53.143 --> 00:22:55.104
You've praised yourself plenty already.

00:22:55.354 --> 00:22:58.983
You didn't even give me
time to praise you.

00:23:00.192 --> 00:23:02.611
You're so mean.

00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:06.573
Mr. Kim, I made the verbal report,
so you write the written one.

00:23:06.657 --> 00:23:08.450
I'm working on it right now.

00:23:08.575 --> 00:23:10.744
I write most of our reports,
so why even ask?

00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:19.962

Yes, Producer Kim.

00:23:40.274 --> 00:23:41.942
I was just about to call you.

00:23:43.444 --> 00:23:44.611
I'm on my way now.

00:23:49.867 --> 00:23:51.535
Where do you think you're going?

00:23:51.618 --> 00:23:53.120
I need to meet someone.

00:23:53.203 --> 00:23:55.247
I'll go straight home after that.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.707
Good work today, Mr. Kim.

00:23:57.416 --> 00:23:59.334
See you tomorrow, sir.

00:24:07.718 --> 00:24:09.845
Man, that was smooth.

00:24:10.596 --> 00:24:11.847
I also need to head out for...

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.140
- Sit back down.
- Yes, sir.

00:24:21.523 --> 00:24:23.442
Just Ms. Lee. She stepped out for a bit.

00:24:25.569 --> 00:24:27.196
Why did you want to see me?

00:24:27.571 --> 00:24:28.906
It's about Minister Kim.

00:24:29.156 --> 00:24:31.533
I spent the past few days
looking into him,

00:24:32.201 --> 00:24:34.203
and there aren't even
any rumors about him.

00:24:34.578 --> 00:24:35.788
I find that weird too.

00:24:36.455 --> 00:24:39.875
There's nothing on the Minister
or the corruption on the news.

00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:43.212
It's one or the other
for someone this powerful.

00:24:43.295 --> 00:24:46.006
It either blows up or gets forgotten.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:49.760
I've covered similar cases
in broadcasting,

00:24:51.011 --> 00:24:54.264
but it all got dismissed, so I quit.

00:24:57.267 --> 00:24:58.102
Producer Kim,

00:25:00.437 --> 00:25:02.731
let's upload that clip of Minister Kim.

00:25:04.817 --> 00:25:06.193
That's what I wanted to hear.

00:25:06.944 --> 00:25:09.822
The video should cause a stir, right?

00:25:09.905 --> 00:25:11.281
There will be something, at least.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.841
Hey.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.260
What?

00:25:32.261 --> 00:25:35.514
What's Lee Geun-cheol doing there?
I'm the Minister.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:38.892
Hey!

00:25:41.687 --> 00:25:44.356
Investigation or whatever,

00:25:44.439 --> 00:25:46.483
I'm the Minister until it's over!

00:25:47.317 --> 00:25:48.152
Hey...

00:25:53.824 --> 00:25:54.992
Damn it!

00:25:58.078 --> 00:26:00.914
How dare these bastards mess with me?

00:26:12.301 --> 00:26:14.386
Hey. Where are you right now?

00:27:13.445 --> 00:27:14.821
Why do you keep following me?

00:27:16.031 --> 00:27:17.783
You were at my house a few days ago too.

00:27:19.493 --> 00:27:21.036
I'm calling the cops.

00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:28.835
Let go!

00:27:31.713 --> 00:27:32.673
Hey!

00:27:44.643 --> 00:27:45.644
Oh, gosh!

00:27:46.478 --> 00:27:47.437
Hey!

00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:50.065
Are you okay?

00:27:50.148 --> 00:27:51.400
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:27:51.483 --> 00:27:53.235
- And you?
- I'm fine.

00:27:53.318 --> 00:27:54.778
How dare they show up here.

00:27:54.861 --> 00:27:57.281
What if they go to Do-yeon?

00:27:57.364 --> 00:27:59.199
- Where is she?
- At kindergarten.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.827
Then Yong-hui would get there faster.

00:28:04.288 --> 00:28:05.831
Yeah, I'm waiting for her.

00:28:06.915 --> 00:28:08.458
The teacher will bring her out.

00:28:18.593 --> 00:28:20.595
Yong-hui is bringing Do-yeon here.

00:28:20.679 --> 00:28:21.513
Okay.

00:28:23.849 --> 00:28:26.476
By the way, are you okay?

00:28:28.228 --> 00:28:29.187
Oh, this?

00:28:29.604 --> 00:28:33.025
I just fell while getting some stuff down.

00:28:33.942 --> 00:28:36.862
Anyway, when did they start following you?

00:28:38.196 --> 00:28:40.324
I didn't notice when I got off the bus,

00:28:40.407 --> 00:28:42.659
but I saw them once I started walking.

00:28:43.285 --> 00:28:44.995
They followed me a few days ago too.

00:28:45.078 --> 00:28:48.457
I hadn't seen them since,
so I thought I was just paranoid.

00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:51.043
Have you told your husband?

00:28:52.252 --> 00:28:53.211
No.

00:28:53.545 --> 00:28:54.838
We'd better tell him.

00:28:55.422 --> 00:28:56.423
Hold on.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.342
Hey, Nam-yeon!

00:28:58.425 --> 00:28:59.718
Where are you?

00:28:59.801 --> 00:29:01.094
- Give me a second.
- Hey.

00:29:08.226 --> 00:29:09.978
When Yong-hui arrives,

00:29:10.062 --> 00:29:12.439
tell him to make sure
he gets Mi-gyeong home safe.

00:29:12.564 --> 00:29:13.607
Where's Kang?

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.442
He doesn't seem to know about it yet.

00:29:16.109 --> 00:29:17.444
Stay here for a bit.

00:29:17.819 --> 00:29:19.321
They're messing with our families now.

00:29:19.404 --> 00:29:21.156
- I'd better check on Min-seo.
- Yes, go.

00:29:32.084 --> 00:29:33.794
Ms. Hwang, you must've been so scared.

00:29:34.544 --> 00:29:37.547
I'm Kwak Byeong-nam,
the youth association president.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.259
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

00:29:41.343 --> 00:29:42.344
I see.

00:29:44.221 --> 00:29:46.139
What happened to your face?

00:29:46.932 --> 00:29:48.183
Oh, this?

00:29:49.017 --> 00:29:52.354
I was feeding some stray cats
when I got attacked by one.

00:29:52.437 --> 00:29:55.607
It smacked me in my face
as soon as I put the bowl down.

00:29:58.485 --> 00:29:59.528
I see.

00:30:00.112 --> 00:30:02.406
Have you called Kang?

00:30:03.198 --> 00:30:05.409
I have, but he's not picking up.

00:30:05.492 --> 00:30:06.326
He must be busy.

00:30:06.618 --> 00:30:09.246
Don't worry.
You have the whole neighborhood with you.

00:30:09.955 --> 00:30:10.997
Okay.

00:30:12.332 --> 00:30:14.042
- Did you watch the music show?
- I did.

00:30:14.126 --> 00:30:15.627
Isn't he so handsome?

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.587
- But he's not my type.
- What?

00:30:17.671 --> 00:30:19.923
What do you mean? I love feminine men.

00:30:20.424 --> 00:30:21.508
- You're weird.
- I love them.

00:30:21.591 --> 00:30:23.218
- I'm going that way.
- Okay.

00:30:23.301 --> 00:30:24.594
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

00:30:45.407 --> 00:30:47.534
Mom? What are you doing here?

00:30:47.617 --> 00:30:51.371
Oh, I was just running an errand nearby.

00:30:51.663 --> 00:30:53.832
I saw you and wanted to say hi.

00:30:55.041 --> 00:30:57.961
Min-seo, let's just go home today.

00:30:58.712 --> 00:31:00.547
Don't go to your afterschool classes.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:02.257
You can have tutoring at home.

00:31:02.883 --> 00:31:04.843
Awesome! That's sweet.

00:31:06.303 --> 00:31:07.804
Gosh.

00:31:08.096 --> 00:31:10.390
Yes, it's awesome.

00:31:17.772 --> 00:31:19.316
MISSED CALLS FROM GENERAL HWANG

00:31:28.492 --> 00:31:29.534
Hey, it's me.

00:31:29.618 --> 00:31:30.994
Why didn't you pick up?

00:31:32.037 --> 00:31:33.788
I was in a meeting.

00:31:33.872 --> 00:31:35.665
I'm on my way now. Is something wrong?

00:31:38.835 --> 00:31:39.669
What?

00:31:49.471 --> 00:31:51.306
- Took you long enough.
- What happened?

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:54.684
Those guys came to the neighborhood again.

00:31:56.728 --> 00:31:58.438
This is why we can't leave loose ends.

00:31:59.147 --> 00:32:01.107
So what's your plan? To kill them all?

00:32:04.319 --> 00:32:05.362
If I must.

00:32:06.488 --> 00:32:08.406
You're not in JDD anymore.

00:32:09.115 --> 00:32:11.535
You're just a regular guy with a family.

00:32:11.618 --> 00:32:13.578
I'm doing this to protect my family.

00:32:13.662 --> 00:32:14.704
By killing people?

00:32:19.709 --> 00:32:22.254
Nam-yeon saved your wife,

00:32:22.337 --> 00:32:24.965
Yong-hui got her and Do-yeon home safely,

00:32:25.632 --> 00:32:28.093
then handed things off to me just now.

00:32:29.928 --> 00:32:31.346
We can protect them together.

00:32:31.429 --> 00:32:34.975
So don't even think
about crossing the line.

00:32:35.809 --> 00:32:36.685
Okay?

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.104
If you cross the line,
even to protect them,

00:32:40.397 --> 00:32:42.732
there will come a day
when Do-yeon will reject you.

00:32:47.946 --> 00:32:48.905
I'm heading up.

00:32:51.032 --> 00:32:53.910
Gosh, you're so stubborn.
Just listen to me.

00:33:12.012 --> 00:33:13.054
Are you okay?

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.181
How's Do-yeon?

00:33:15.724 --> 00:33:17.309
She fell asleep while reading.

00:33:18.101 --> 00:33:19.060
You can check on her.

00:33:49.883 --> 00:33:50.925
Mi-gyeong.

00:33:51.009 --> 00:33:52.677
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

00:33:54.429 --> 00:33:55.430
I'm sorry.

00:33:55.805 --> 00:33:59.309
I had a meeting with someone,
and the cell reception there was bad.

00:34:02.479 --> 00:34:03.521
Have a seat.

00:34:14.324 --> 00:34:16.618
What's going on in this neighborhood?

00:34:17.744 --> 00:34:21.831
Ms. Jung's face was fine at the market,
but it's all beaten up now.

00:34:22.415 --> 00:34:24.459
And so is Mr. Kwak's face.

00:34:26.336 --> 00:34:27.754
Don't try to play games.

00:34:28.088 --> 00:34:29.130
Tell me everything.

00:34:47.524 --> 00:34:49.109
Remember how I got hurt

00:34:51.152 --> 00:34:55.323
because the ATM booth exploded
when I was taking the trash out?

00:34:58.743 --> 00:35:02.414
That was from a bomb explosion.

00:35:37.282 --> 00:35:39.159
THE THRILLING MOMENT
OF SAVING PRODUCER KIM!

00:35:39.242 --> 00:35:41.703
THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE
ABDUCTED A CIVILIAN?

00:35:42.871 --> 00:35:45.999
Didn't I tell you
to get rid of Kim In-seop?

00:35:47.667 --> 00:35:50.003
You plan to keep up with this shit job?

00:35:51.254 --> 00:35:52.797
I told you to leave no trace

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:56.843
of anyone and anything
related to the bombs.

00:35:57.802 --> 00:35:59.095
What should I do with you?

00:35:59.179 --> 00:36:01.014
SAFE GAS STATION

00:36:01.097 --> 00:36:02.140
Producer Kim,

00:36:02.223 --> 00:36:04.517
how could you upload the video
without talking to us?

00:36:04.601 --> 00:36:06.811
I told you
there was an internal investigation.

00:36:06.895 --> 00:36:10.064
There's nothing about him on the news,
not even on social media.

00:36:11.566 --> 00:36:14.068
And this is illegal evidence
that we can't even use in court.

00:36:14.152 --> 00:36:17.614
They'll just stall for time
before covering all this up.

00:36:17.697 --> 00:36:20.283
I know because
I've covered similar cases before.

00:36:20.366 --> 00:36:22.535
You still should've discussed it with us.

00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:24.704
We would've just wasted time!

00:36:25.038 --> 00:36:28.249
We don't know
what they're plotting right now!

00:36:30.668 --> 00:36:31.920
What do you think you're doing?

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.339
Uploading the video without a heads-up?

00:36:37.008 --> 00:36:38.384
That's for me to ask.

00:36:40.053 --> 00:36:43.723
Those guys tried to abduct my wife
in broad daylight.

00:36:43.807 --> 00:36:45.433
Right in the neighborhood too.

00:36:46.392 --> 00:36:47.393
What?

00:36:49.604 --> 00:36:52.315
Perhaps you just don't care
about civilians.

00:36:53.525 --> 00:36:56.361
The higher your position,
the less you notice these things.

00:37:31.062 --> 00:37:33.147
Hey, I need to see you.

00:37:34.315 --> 00:37:35.358
Where?

00:37:39.153 --> 00:37:41.698
Fine, I'll see you there.

00:37:45.076 --> 00:37:46.160
Turn the car around.

00:37:51.082 --> 00:37:51.916
Hey!

00:37:52.709 --> 00:37:56.212
We could've met at the base
once you were down!

00:37:57.797 --> 00:37:59.507
But no, you just had to insist.

00:37:59.591 --> 00:38:01.885
You're a real soldier, indeed.

00:38:02.552 --> 00:38:03.887
You've got good stamina.

00:38:16.399 --> 00:38:17.650
Did you see the video?

00:38:23.364 --> 00:38:24.949
You're screwed.

00:38:25.283 --> 00:38:27.368
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

00:38:28.995 --> 00:38:30.580
I'm not joking.

00:38:31.581 --> 00:38:33.583
You're hanging on by a thread.

00:38:33.666 --> 00:38:34.834
Damn it!

00:38:36.878 --> 00:38:38.379
Take a deep breath.

00:38:38.463 --> 00:38:40.089
The air is fresh here, you know?

00:38:41.132 --> 00:38:45.303
A breath of fresh air
can inspire all sorts of ideas.

00:38:47.347 --> 00:38:48.389
I'm dizzy.

00:38:49.015 --> 00:38:50.725
Did you find the guy behind the bombs?

00:38:51.517 --> 00:38:52.602
It was Sullivan.

00:38:53.895 --> 00:38:56.481
The investor for the specialized IT zone.

00:38:57.774 --> 00:38:59.233
Sullivan.

00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:01.569
How bold of him.

00:39:02.862 --> 00:39:03.947
Tell me about it.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.115
Some nerve, huh?

00:39:06.199 --> 00:39:09.619
He paid double the price
to buy the arms we sold off.

00:39:10.453 --> 00:39:11.371
What do we do?

00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:17.710
How much do you trust me?

00:39:18.753 --> 00:39:19.671
Huh?

00:39:21.005 --> 00:39:21.965
A lot?

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.512
I told you. We're on the same boat.

00:39:29.639 --> 00:39:31.641
Get a bomb ready.

00:39:31.975 --> 00:39:33.476
To blow up Kiyun-si.

00:39:34.602 --> 00:39:35.436
What?

00:39:39.983 --> 00:39:40.900
All right.

00:39:41.609 --> 00:39:43.152
This is good.

00:39:43.653 --> 00:39:46.656
This is awesome.

00:39:51.411 --> 00:39:53.162
Blow up Kiyun-si?

00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:55.873
Blow up the police station.

00:39:56.249 --> 00:39:57.625
It's symbolic.

00:39:57.709 --> 00:39:59.794
The symbol of public authority and safety.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.672
- Why?
- Why else?

00:40:03.047 --> 00:40:05.800
If we say Sullivan is doing this
out of revenge

00:40:05.883 --> 00:40:08.511
and that the reporter is on his side,

00:40:08.594 --> 00:40:10.096
the public wouldn't forgive them.

00:40:10.638 --> 00:40:12.348
You can step up then

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.644
and say you were just
trying to get the terrorist.

00:40:17.854 --> 00:40:19.022
Man!

00:40:21.357 --> 00:40:23.901
She's so creative, huh?

00:40:24.444 --> 00:40:26.070
I should learn from her.

00:40:26.154 --> 00:40:28.656
Oh, gosh.

00:40:39.125 --> 00:40:41.878
Seok-jun, you moron.

00:40:45.673 --> 00:40:46.716
Sullivan.

00:40:47.884 --> 00:40:51.262
How dare you test me?

00:40:52.805 --> 00:40:55.850
I'll just blow up both of you at once.

00:40:59.187 --> 00:41:00.813
How does this make any sense?

00:41:00.897 --> 00:41:03.858
A can of butane gas from a shop
caused an explosion, leading to a death...

00:41:03.941 --> 00:41:06.194
Apologies, sir. I'll take care of it.

00:41:06.277 --> 00:41:09.030
- Take care of what? Huh?
- And most importantly,

00:41:09.113 --> 00:41:11.491
- the locals are terrified.
- What can you even do?

00:41:12.867 --> 00:41:16.120
Therefore, I will file a strong complaint

00:41:16.204 --> 00:41:17.747
to the butane gas manufacturer

00:41:18.456 --> 00:41:22.752
and hold the former government
accountable once again.

00:41:22.835 --> 00:41:26.005
MAMMOSEU MART

00:41:26.672 --> 00:41:29.717
Anyone can tell that this is Nam-yeon.

00:41:30.259 --> 00:41:31.677
I knew it.

00:41:31.761 --> 00:41:34.806
It all makes sense now. I get it.

00:41:37.183 --> 00:41:39.018
She's so incredible.

00:41:46.067 --> 00:41:47.235
What's with you?

00:41:47.318 --> 00:41:49.362
Just stay still.

00:41:50.822 --> 00:41:52.907
Thank you for everything.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:55.743
You got injured trying to protect the town
and had to keep quiet.

00:41:56.577 --> 00:41:58.871
What? How did you find out?

00:41:59.288 --> 00:42:00.748
I'm your husband. How could I not?

00:42:00.832 --> 00:42:01.666
I just get it.

00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:06.254
Nam-yeon,

00:42:07.255 --> 00:42:08.631
I always have your back.

00:42:09.173 --> 00:42:11.926
Don't worry and spread your wings.

00:42:14.428 --> 00:42:15.471
You're incredible.

00:42:21.102 --> 00:42:22.061
What the...

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.230
Did Byeong-nam tell him?

00:42:32.738 --> 00:42:35.074
Wow, impressive.

00:42:35.158 --> 00:42:36.742
It's like a movie.

00:42:36.826 --> 00:42:38.494
Is that really Nam-yeon?

00:42:38.578 --> 00:42:40.371
Yeah, you know her.

00:42:40.454 --> 00:42:42.707
She was an instructor in the 707th Unit

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.209
and recently even defused a bomb.

00:42:45.334 --> 00:42:47.170
Yeah, that's true.

00:42:47.253 --> 00:42:50.214
But wow, amazing.

00:42:51.048 --> 00:42:53.634
You know the gas station
at the town entrance?

00:42:53.718 --> 00:42:54.552
Yeah.

00:42:54.635 --> 00:42:58.681
I have a feeling that they hold
some strategic meetings there.

00:42:58.764 --> 00:43:01.392
It's the perfect place
to be out of everyone's eyes.

00:43:01.475 --> 00:43:04.562
You mean the underground level
of the gas station, then.

00:43:05.229 --> 00:43:06.147
The underground?

00:43:06.439 --> 00:43:10.067
They were digging so deep into the ground
when building that gas station

00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:12.653
that I wondered
if it was for an oil storage,

00:43:13.154 --> 00:43:15.406
but they built something like a shelter.

00:43:15.823 --> 00:43:16.782
A shelter?

00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:20.828
You know, where people hide
when there's a war.

00:43:24.582 --> 00:43:26.042
Oh, that's why!

00:43:26.375 --> 00:43:29.086
No wonder I couldn't see anyone.

00:43:30.004 --> 00:43:30.880
That's why!

00:43:36.385 --> 00:43:37.470
Min-seo.

00:43:42.475 --> 00:43:43.476
Hey!

00:43:48.064 --> 00:43:49.690
What brings you here?

00:43:51.275 --> 00:43:53.069
What happened to your face?

00:43:53.152 --> 00:43:55.488
Did you fight my mom?
Her face is also scratched up.

00:43:55.571 --> 00:43:57.073
Me, fight your mom?

00:43:58.241 --> 00:43:59.492
I'm here to pick you up.

00:44:01.202 --> 00:44:03.120
But there's plenty of time
before we start.

00:44:04.372 --> 00:44:05.748
Didn't your mom tell you?

00:44:06.249 --> 00:44:08.376
I'll be picking you up for the time being.

00:44:08.709 --> 00:44:09.543
Let's go.

00:44:12.004 --> 00:44:13.339
No way. Why?

00:44:14.006 --> 00:44:15.800
To start our session sooner.

00:44:20.388 --> 00:44:22.306
What about the days we don't meet?

00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:25.184
I'll still pick you up. Get in.

00:44:28.271 --> 00:44:29.897
- Put on your seatbelt.
- Okay.

00:44:39.949 --> 00:44:41.409
Whatever it is,

00:44:41.492 --> 00:44:44.537
just don't let it
get to Do-yeon or me, okay?

00:44:45.413 --> 00:44:46.789
We can protect them together.

00:44:47.623 --> 00:44:50.126
So don't even think
about crossing the line.

00:44:50.668 --> 00:44:52.586
If you cross the line,
even to protect them,

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.964
there will come a day
when Do-yeon will reject you.

00:44:59.802 --> 00:45:03.431
LEE YONG-HUI

00:45:03.514 --> 00:45:05.850
Yes, I just brought her to the gym.

00:45:05.933 --> 00:45:09.937
I'll keep her at my gym
until you or your wife comes,

00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:12.481
so don't worry and take your time.

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:15.484
- Thank you.
- Master Lee!

00:45:15.568 --> 00:45:17.028
Let's play together.

00:45:17.111 --> 00:45:19.155
All right. See you later, Kang.

00:45:29.623 --> 00:45:32.043
MAMMOSEU MART

00:45:37.965 --> 00:45:40.134
You can head in first. I'll park the car.

00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:41.844
Okay.

00:46:07.703 --> 00:46:08.954
Lee Su-jin speaking.

00:46:10.289 --> 00:46:11.374
Jeong-hwan?

00:46:12.917 --> 00:46:14.627
What? Mercenaries?

00:46:15.336 --> 00:46:16.712
Wait! Let me talk to him.

00:46:18.422 --> 00:46:20.091
What about mercenaries? Go again.

00:46:21.884 --> 00:46:22.843
Again?

00:46:23.219 --> 00:46:26.222
Why do these bastards keep messing around
in our neighborhood?

00:46:26.305 --> 00:46:27.765
I'm tailing them right now.

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:29.809
Okay, I'll make the calls.

00:46:31.185 --> 00:46:32.353
What did he say?

00:46:32.436 --> 00:46:34.146
Those guys are back.

00:46:35.606 --> 00:46:37.858
It must be
because of the video I uploaded.

00:46:37.942 --> 00:46:39.276
No.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.194
CHOI KANG

00:46:40.277 --> 00:46:42.321
There's no cell reception. I'm off.

00:46:52.957 --> 00:46:54.625
- Hey.
- Hey, Kang.

00:46:55.334 --> 00:46:57.169
Those guys are in our neighborhood again.

00:46:57.753 --> 00:46:58.796
Where?

00:46:58.879 --> 00:47:00.881
Jeong-hwan is tailing them right now.

00:47:00.965 --> 00:47:03.426
I'll be there in 20 minutes.
Tell me where he is.

00:47:07.304 --> 00:47:08.556
I won't kill them, all right?

00:47:08.931 --> 00:47:10.099
Good.

00:47:10.182 --> 00:47:12.435
There's nothing bad
about listening to your elders.

00:47:12.518 --> 00:47:14.353
Gosh, his temper.

00:47:22.528 --> 00:47:23.612
PARK JEONG-HWAN

00:47:25.489 --> 00:47:26.323
Hello?

00:47:27.032 --> 00:47:28.033
The police station?

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:31.162
There are security cameras there.

00:47:31.245 --> 00:47:32.163
Hold on.

00:47:39.003 --> 00:47:42.465
CHANGRI POLICE STATION

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:46.469
- Hello!
- Hey.

00:47:46.552 --> 00:47:48.596
I told you I could pick it up.

00:47:49.513 --> 00:47:52.391
You already do so much for us.
It's the least I can do.

00:47:52.516 --> 00:47:54.560
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

00:47:54.643 --> 00:47:57.021
Oh, right. Have you...

00:47:57.104 --> 00:47:58.898
Have you watched it?

00:47:58.981 --> 00:47:59.940
Watch what?

00:48:00.024 --> 00:48:02.818
You know, the video online.

00:48:13.662 --> 00:48:14.914
Su-il?

00:48:14.997 --> 00:48:16.665
SU-IL

00:48:30.054 --> 00:48:31.055
Gosh.

00:48:31.555 --> 00:48:32.848
Hey, Byeong-nam.

00:48:32.932 --> 00:48:35.893
Hey, you see that box
in front of the police station?

00:48:36.143 --> 00:48:37.520
What? A box?

00:48:39.188 --> 00:48:40.064
A box?

00:48:42.942 --> 00:48:45.569
Yeah, I see it.

00:48:45.819 --> 00:48:46.987
Is it for Officer Park?

00:48:47.071 --> 00:48:49.406
No, don't go back in. Just open the box.

00:48:50.199 --> 00:48:51.242
Okay.

00:48:52.576 --> 00:48:55.246
Hold up. How did you know I was here?

00:48:55.329 --> 00:48:56.497
Just open it.

00:48:57.122 --> 00:48:58.165
But it's not mine.

00:48:58.249 --> 00:48:59.708
Just open it.

00:49:00.042 --> 00:49:00.876
I don't want to.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.127
Come on!

00:49:02.211 --> 00:49:03.837
Just open it!

00:49:03.921 --> 00:49:05.714
So demanding. Fine.

00:49:06.382 --> 00:49:09.468
What is it? Why do I need to open it?

00:49:26.068 --> 00:49:29.613
Hold up. Hey, Byeong-nam,

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.241
it's a bomb.

00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:33.867
What do I do?

00:49:37.288 --> 00:49:39.873
Listen to me carefully.

00:49:40.416 --> 00:49:43.419
Leave that there,
and drive as far away as possible.

00:49:43.502 --> 00:49:44.628
Okay.

00:49:44.712 --> 00:49:47.339
Hey, wait. Officer Park is inside.

00:49:47.423 --> 00:49:49.341
Tell him to run away, too.

00:49:49.425 --> 00:49:51.719
Okay, I'm hanging up.

00:49:51.802 --> 00:49:52.636
Hold up.

00:50:00.894 --> 00:50:01.979
Hold up.

00:50:04.273 --> 00:50:05.274
Hold up.

00:50:27.713 --> 00:50:29.882
I'm heading to the Hanbal Mountain.

00:50:29.965 --> 00:50:31.842
- Be careful.
- Okay.

00:50:31.925 --> 00:50:33.552
They're taking the ring road.

00:50:40.934 --> 00:50:41.977
Hey, go faster.

00:50:53.113 --> 00:50:54.531
What is he doing?

00:50:54.615 --> 00:50:56.325
What are you doing? Run!

00:50:57.493 --> 00:51:00.287
It can't explode here.

00:51:00.371 --> 00:51:01.372
What is he...

00:51:17.179 --> 00:51:18.639
Has he lost his mind?

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.581
Byeong-nam! What's going on?

00:51:44.665 --> 00:51:47.292
Hey, look for the Mammoseu Mart van
with the security cameras.

00:51:47.376 --> 00:51:48.961
- Okay.
- Hurry!

00:51:58.721 --> 00:51:59.888
KWAK BYEONG-NAM

00:52:00.973 --> 00:52:02.141
Hey.

00:52:02.474 --> 00:52:04.393
Su-il, can you hear me?

00:52:04.643 --> 00:52:05.811
What are you thinking?

00:52:06.478 --> 00:52:07.563
No idea.

00:52:07.646 --> 00:52:11.316
But this can't go off
in the middle of the town.

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.277
How far am I from the ocean?

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.988
We don't know when it'll go off!
The ocean is too far!

00:52:20.325 --> 00:52:21.493
I'll call you back.

00:52:22.077 --> 00:52:24.204
I need a proper farewell with Nam-yeon.

00:52:24.288 --> 00:52:25.414
Su-il!

00:52:25.497 --> 00:52:26.665
Damn it!

00:52:45.934 --> 00:52:47.686
What's going on?
You should be back by now.

00:52:49.021 --> 00:52:50.606
Hey, Nam-yeon.

00:52:51.273 --> 00:52:52.941
What is it now?

00:52:53.442 --> 00:52:57.654
You know, you and Minseo...

00:52:59.114 --> 00:53:00.824
You guys are my everything.

00:53:00.908 --> 00:53:02.034
You know that, right?

00:53:02.451 --> 00:53:04.578
What's going on?

00:53:04.661 --> 00:53:06.079
Are you hurt?

00:53:06.705 --> 00:53:08.415
I, Kim Su-il,

00:53:09.416 --> 00:53:11.668
have only loved you,

00:53:13.962 --> 00:53:15.255
Jung Nam-yeon.

00:53:15.714 --> 00:53:17.299
I'm asking you what's going on!

00:53:38.237 --> 00:53:39.238
KWAK BYEONG-NAM

00:53:39.321 --> 00:53:42.866
He just has to ruin
my main character moment.

00:53:44.409 --> 00:53:45.994
What now?

00:53:46.078 --> 00:53:48.622
Su-il, come to the gas station.

00:53:48.705 --> 00:53:50.874
With the bomb? Are you crazy?

00:53:51.708 --> 00:53:54.002
Just do as I say. How long will it take?

00:55:37.439 --> 00:55:38.273
No...

00:56:20.857 --> 00:56:23.819
SAFE GAS STATION

00:56:23.902 --> 00:56:26.822
- Why did you do that?
- Stop yelling at him!

00:56:26.905 --> 00:56:28.657
He saved the world!

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.367
Yeah, I saved the world.

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:33.286
It would've been a disaster
if it weren't for him.

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:40.502
He just has to ruin
my main character moment.

00:56:42.129 --> 00:56:43.255
What now?

00:56:43.338 --> 00:56:45.674
Su-il, come to the gas station.

00:56:46.133 --> 00:56:48.468
With the bomb? Are you crazy?

00:56:48.552 --> 00:56:50.887
Just do as I say. How long will it take?

00:56:51.263 --> 00:56:52.597
About two minutes?

00:56:53.098 --> 00:56:54.725
That soon?

00:56:54.975 --> 00:56:57.227
Hey, who do you think I am?

00:56:57.811 --> 00:56:59.021
Just hold on.

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:09.114
- It could've been a disaster.
- You're amazing, Su-il!

00:57:09.197 --> 00:57:10.323
I was so worried!

00:57:10.407 --> 00:57:12.909
Mr. Kim, you'll move
to a different shelter today.

00:57:13.243 --> 00:57:14.745
Oh, where?

00:57:14.828 --> 00:57:18.373
I can't tell you where,
but it'll be safer than here.

00:57:19.124 --> 00:57:19.958
Okay.

00:57:20.417 --> 00:57:22.586
You were incredible, Su-il.

00:57:22.669 --> 00:57:24.963
- The counter-terrorism unit is coming.
- Are they?

00:57:25.047 --> 00:57:27.758
How did you think
to bring this here anyway?

00:57:27.841 --> 00:57:30.719
I knew all radio waves
are blocked off here.

00:57:30.802 --> 00:57:32.220
What if it were a time bomb?

00:57:32.304 --> 00:57:33.722
I know, Byeong-nam!

00:57:33.805 --> 00:57:37.142
That was the first thing I checked.

00:57:37.225 --> 00:57:38.226
You think I'm dumb?

00:57:38.727 --> 00:57:41.563
Anyway, it would've been better for it
to explode here than in town.

00:57:41.646 --> 00:57:42.481
That's true.

00:57:42.564 --> 00:57:44.608
You almost made me explode.

00:57:44.691 --> 00:57:46.193
- Stop it.
- Come on, that hurts.

00:57:46.276 --> 00:57:48.487
Seriously, cut it out.

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:50.072
Why you little...

00:57:51.114 --> 00:57:53.575
Anyway, what is this place?

00:57:53.658 --> 00:57:54.910
It looks so cool.

00:57:55.368 --> 00:57:56.578
Wait. You guys, too.

00:58:00.999 --> 00:58:03.210
You guys are like heroes.

00:58:03.502 --> 00:58:04.669
Heroes Next Door.

00:58:05.504 --> 00:58:07.380
"Heroes Next Door"? That sounds lame.

00:58:07.464 --> 00:58:09.424
What are we, Power Rangers?

00:58:09.508 --> 00:58:11.593
- Hey, I think it sounds cool!
- I like it.

00:58:12.511 --> 00:58:14.012
Power Rangers? Are you kidding me?

00:58:14.096 --> 00:58:16.515
I just thought it sounded lame...

00:58:16.598 --> 00:58:18.058
You're lame.

00:58:19.518 --> 00:58:20.769
Your face is lame.

00:58:57.889 --> 00:58:59.099
Where are you going?

00:59:15.699 --> 00:59:17.367
Did you give the order
to abduct Mi-gyeong?

00:59:18.827 --> 00:59:20.787
What the hell are you talking about?

00:59:32.007 --> 00:59:33.925
Don't make me repeat myself.

00:59:34.009 --> 00:59:35.844
You're Choi Kang, aren't you?

00:59:36.386 --> 00:59:37.804
Who the hell are you?

00:59:37.888 --> 00:59:39.139
I'll be asking the questions here.

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.476
Did you give the order to abduct my wife?

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:48.565
That's right. I did.

00:59:49.858 --> 00:59:50.942
Why?

00:59:51.026 --> 00:59:52.402
Why do you think?

00:59:52.819 --> 00:59:54.571
To get you, of course.

00:59:55.864 --> 00:59:57.824
Who set off the bombs in Changri-dong?

00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:01.244
That's none of your business.

01:00:01.328 --> 01:00:02.954
I told you. Don't make me repeat myself.

01:00:03.955 --> 01:00:07.792
It was Sullivan! It was Jame Sullivan!

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:13.840
I confirmed
that Sullivan bought the bombs.

01:00:18.094 --> 01:00:19.054
Watch out!

01:00:20.555 --> 01:00:22.224
My Myeong-o...

01:00:22.307 --> 01:00:25.560
- Where did you get that ice cream?
- That man gave me ice cream.

01:00:25.644 --> 01:00:28.021
Guess who we ran into on our way home?

01:00:28.104 --> 01:00:28.939
Sullivan.

01:00:29.022 --> 01:00:30.815
YOU'RE MAKING THINGS COMPLICATED
JDD SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES, CHOI KANG

01:00:36.321 --> 01:00:40.033
You've got the wrong guy.

01:00:41.826 --> 01:00:42.869
Who says?

01:02:36.399 --> 01:02:39.444
We finally meet, Mr. Choi Kang.

01:03:37.794 --> 01:03:40.713
HEROES NEXT DOOR

01:03:40.797 --> 01:03:41.923
How did you know about me?

01:03:42.006 --> 01:03:45.135
What should be done about
someone who manipulated a court ruling?

01:03:45.218 --> 01:03:47.220
I'm getting blackmailed.

01:03:47.303 --> 01:03:49.180
It's your turn now.

01:03:49.264 --> 01:03:51.433
There will be another bomb.

01:03:51.516 --> 01:03:52.434
Good luck finding it.

01:03:52.517 --> 01:03:55.270
Sullivan's guys are pros. We might die.

01:03:55.353 --> 01:03:56.396
He'll blow everything up.

01:03:56.479 --> 01:03:58.857
Seems like Sullivan
will do something to this neighborhood.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.525
What, are you immortal?

01:04:00.608 --> 01:04:03.027
Wouldn't one of the bombs
be at the interview?

01:04:03.111 --> 01:04:06.072
I won't let you off with a warning
if you meddle with my plans again.

01:04:06.197 --> 01:04:07.866
- Kang.
- Stay back!

01:04:09.742 --> 01:04:11.786
