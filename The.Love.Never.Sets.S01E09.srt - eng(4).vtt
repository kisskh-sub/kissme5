00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.000
Do you think Saint and Book, like each other?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600
I didn’t want you to be angry.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.360
But I had to distance myself because…

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.360
My dad told Benz to keep an eye on me.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.200
Then why were you flirting with Book?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.360
I’ve always been clear.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.920
About who I want to be with.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.840
We want both of you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.000
to be a couple for one day.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Be my boyfriend for one day?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.320
My bear?

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.760
Don’t move so much.

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.120
What are you supposed to call me?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.080
Call me Little Bear.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.840
Are you serious?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
No, creepy.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.759
If you don’t call me that,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.920
I’ll tell Sea.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.039
Annoying.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.600
So,

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.360
what about tomorrow?

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.840
Where are we going on our date?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.320
Don’t worry about that,Panda.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.720
Little Bear has it all planned out.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.800
Tomorrow,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.520
make sure you wake up on time.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.720
Five a.m.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.800
Huh,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.720
five a.m.?!

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680
I’m not going with you.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.360
Who goes on a crazy date at five a.m.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.600
Go alone then.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.240
I’m not going.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720
But Sea said so.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.640
Or if you're not going to do it.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.160
I’ll handle Sea.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.440
but I’m not going on the date.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Who goes at five a.m. anyway.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.920
Well…

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.720
I’ll wake you up.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.960
I’ll wake you.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.320
Go ahead.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.600
I’ll wake you.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.680
I’m not going.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.600
Are you trying to force me.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.440
Huh.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.800
We’re a couple.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.920
How is it forcing?

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.600
Ouch.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.280
It hasn’t even started yet!

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.720
Goodnight, Panda.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.800
Morning.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.159
Not yet.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.720
I want to sleep some more.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.120
Wake up.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.000
Wake up.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.040
Wake up, we got to go.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.880
Wake up, it's already late.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.440
Just a little more.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.560
Are you getting up or not?

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.360
No.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.000
Fine.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.800
Wake up.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.920
Get up already, come here.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.000
Wake up.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.920
Get up, you’re late.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.560
Hurry.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.320
Hurry.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.600
Hey.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.240
Saint.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.040
Hurry up.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.400
No.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.680
I’m not getting up.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.640
Saint!.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.520
I’m awake, I’m awake.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.440
Let go of me.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.000
Okay, okay.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.320
I’m letting go.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.080
You’re heavier than I thought.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.440
You don’t have to do all this, you know.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.280
No.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.960
Since I’m doing it,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.200
I have to make it realistic.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.000
Like when Kit and Seen go on dates.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.200
Like how?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.000
Hey.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.160
What are you doing?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.880
Brushing your teeth.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.920
Hey, I can do it myself.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.680
Well, before this you didn't have me.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.200
Here.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.200
No need.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.480
Wash your face.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.600
You’re starting to do more than

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.680
what Sea ordered you to.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.080
No I’m not.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.320
Even if she didn’t tell me to.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.920
I still want to do it.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.840
(I once went through pain.)

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.320
(But then you came and gathered my broken heart.)

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.840
(You healed the wounds that never faded.)

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.800
(The feeling I have when I’m with you.)

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.760
Here.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.080
What?

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.000
Wear this.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.440
No.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.800
Fine.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.920
What are you doing?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.440
Why aren't you wearing it?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I'm going on a date with you like this.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.520
Whatever.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.640
Hey.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.600
What do you mean whatever?

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.520
Hey. What?

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.800
Are you going to wear it? Saint.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.600
Ow. Oh.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.720
No.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.320
Are you going to wear it?

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.040
No.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.840
Why would I wear it?

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.520
Then we'll stay like this.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.200
If I had a boyfriend,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.320
I'd lay around hugging him like this all day.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.080
Uh... Fine.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.320
I'll wear it.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.680
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.640
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.520
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.000
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.200
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.840
Hey!

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.040
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.840
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.760
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:25.160
(The distance from the sun to a sunflower like me.)

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.160
(No matter how far,)

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.400
(the light will always reach me.)

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.280
(And nobody can ever take your place)

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.680
(because love has tied our hearts together.)

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.400
Have some.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.520
(I promise that every second, there is only you.)

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.440
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.440
I'm a great boyfriend, right?

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.040
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.680
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.680
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.720
Hey.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.280
What are you doing?

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.680
No.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.400
We're..

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.400
We're on a date as a couple?

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.440
Ah.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.520
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.480
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.280
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.320
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.920
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.840
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.640
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.000
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.920
We could enter a Loy Krathong contest

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.040
dressed like this.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.760
We look like characters from classic literature,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.640
right?

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.280
Yeah.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.800
Am I pretty?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.040
Pretty.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.840
What was that?

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.440
Very pretty.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.800
Lanee is really pretty today.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.200
When you compliment me like that…

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.840
I get shy, you know.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.880
Do I really have to dance?

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.800
What?

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:22.760
Well,

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.520
I saw they needed it for the workshop.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.680
So I went to find it for you.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.600
Mm.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.960
I'll teach you.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.600
First move, okay.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.080
This is me.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.360
Okay again.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.680
Me.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.240
Come on.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.720
Me, like this. No.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.320
Me.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.480
Please?

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.040
Me.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.720
I’m happy.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.480
I’m happy.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.040
I'm so happy to be here with you.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.760
You’re really over the top.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.280
Hey, it’s so you can use it in the workshop.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.080
Isn’t that good?

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.000
It is.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.000
Then…

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.800
What does this one mean.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.720
Watch.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.120
Where.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.080
I.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.400
Love.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.000
You.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.320
I love you?

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.360
Mm.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.680
Are you saying you love me?

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.280
If you already knew the dance moves,

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.440
you should have told me first.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.080
I wanted you to teach me, it’s cute.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Then I’m going to be mad at you now.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.880
Oh, let me make it up to you.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.640
Can I?

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.800
Can I?

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.480
Fine.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.680
You dance well.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.000
You’re pretty.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.480
You don’t need to be an executive producer anymore.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.480
Go act as Scene instead of Ice?

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.760
Seriously?

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.280
I'll do it.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.080
We’ll fire Ice tomorrow.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.120
But you have to say it yourself.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.440
I’m not getting involved.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.920
Huh, you’re the director?

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.800
You have to talk to him.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.600
But there’s one thing I want to be more.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.000
What is it?

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.120
Your girlfriend.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.720
Lanee?

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.960
Be with me.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.920
I know you feel the same.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.360
From now on

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.520
don’t be cute with anyone else.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.280
And don’t do the pouty face for anyone either.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.040
Okay?

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.280
Okay, my girlfriend.~

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.200
Okay.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.440
I have a girlfriend now.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.000
Let’s take a photo.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.400
Oh. Okay.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.920
Cute pose.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.200
Cute pose, okay. One.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.600
Two.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.160
Three.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.320
One.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.200
Two.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.120
Three.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.600
Ready.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.120
Three.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:21.720
Two.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.240
I’ll get it for you.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.480
Here.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.000
Hey,

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.760
this looks nice.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.080
You can custom order it.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.360
One of a kind.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:09.720
Yeah.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.640
How much is it.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.640
Only twelve thousand.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.280
Want it?

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.120
I’ll engrave your name too.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.960
What design?

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.560
Uh…

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.320
No thanks.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.520
Oh, Saint.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.000
There you are.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.200
I finally found someone I feel comfortable with.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.440
Not like someone else…

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.240
Being around them is suffocating as hell.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.840
Yeah right.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.720
I’m not handsome and kind…

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.280
Comfortable like your other friend.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:54.920
Saint.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.320
Come hang out with me today.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.360
He's driving me crazy.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.480
Hey,

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.880
how long are you two gonna talk?

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.280
We came as four and you’re only talking to each other.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.160
Saint.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.119
Come look at tie-dye with me.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.079
Ice.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.040
Do you know when I was just with him just now.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.720
He didn’t talk to me at all!

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.960
So suffocating.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.280
Calm down.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.120
Are you fighting with Book or what.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.480
The other day I asked him about Saint.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.800
He said I was toxic and talking badly to him.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.360
He said I’m not like Saint…

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.040
Who makes him feel comfortable.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.400
Book said that.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.200
Yeah.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.280
I swear those two must like each other.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.560
Shit.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.080
What do I do.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.160
Wait…

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.440
Are you

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.200
jealous of Book?

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:07.680
Huh.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.280
What do you mean jealous?

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.400
Huh?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.680
If you’re not jealous,

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.120
why are you stressed like this?

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.440
Ice, stop saying dumb shit.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.000
See?

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.600
I don’t know if Saint and Book like each other.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.720
But you…

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.040
You one hundred percent like Book.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.000
Fuck that!

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:28.960
Mm.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.240
I just want to know

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.600
if Saint and Book really like each other.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.000
I…

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.880
I just want to be nosy.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.520
Did Saint ever say anything to you about Book?

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.880
Like hinting,

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.440
bringing him up, something like that.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.200
I don’t know.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.200
But I’m sure they like each other.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.720
I'm sure about it

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.440
Try thinking if he ever mentioned Book?

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.360
I said I don’t know.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.400
If you want to know, just ask him.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.080
Huh?

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.160
Hey, wait for me.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.720
Mine turned out so nice.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.120
Right.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.040
Yeah,

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.360
you're so talented.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.320
Teach me.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.360
I still can’t tie it.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.280
Just keep doing it.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.120
Come, I’ll do it for you.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.920
No.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.000
What.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.440
Why can’t I help.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.360
You’re annoying.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.360
Don’t bother me.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.520
Why do you hate me so much.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.640
I don’t hate you,

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.040
it’s just my shirt.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.440
I can do it myself.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.080
No, I’ll do it.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.560
No.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:03.840
Let go.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.440
I’ll do it myself.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.720
Let go.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.440
I’ll do it myself.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.240
I said let go.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.080
Let go.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.760
Give it.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.520
I said let go.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.120
Let go.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.640
Ow.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.360
Hey.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.400
Are you okay. Shit.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.400
I said let go.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.640
See? It’s all stained now.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.280
I’m sorry, Book.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.160
I didn’t mean to.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:27.800
Come here.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.480
Where are we going?

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.000
Come on.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.680
(Natural dye tie-dye cloth,)

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.560
(community agricultural enterprise.)

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.360
Shit.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.160
It won’t come out.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.400
You!

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.680
Forget it.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.560
No.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.960
I’ve done a lot of wrong things to you.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.480
I don’t want to be a shitty friend in your eyes.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.560
I want to be a good friend in your eyes too.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.480
If it won’t come off then it won’t come off.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.760
Give me back the shirt.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.680
Do you like Saint or what?

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:23.520
Huh?

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.360
I’m asking you, so answer.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.480
I’m leaving.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.040
Answer me first.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840
Let me go.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.560
Answer me first!

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.840
Why do you want to know?

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.600
Do you like me?

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.560
Yeah!

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.760
Do you even realize what you just said?

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.600
I like you.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.560
I’m not okay

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.160
when you spend a long time with someone else.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.560
Like when you’re with Saint.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.800
I’m sorry I freaked out on you the whole week.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.000
But everything I did…

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.040
I realized I like you.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.160
Can you like me back?

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
From now on

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.160
don’t go liking anyone else anymore.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.080
Can I be the one

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.560
who gets to fall asleep hugging you every day?

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.200
Not just as a friend.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.920
I like you.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.800
Do you like me?

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.080
Come here, I’ll help.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.160
What’s wrong?

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.800
I have a question I want to ask.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.880
But I don’t have to ask.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.920
But I also don’t want it to keep bothering me.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.760
Then just ask.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.560
If I can answer, I will.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.520
About the red sunflower.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.840
You used it to flirt with Book, right?

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.600
No.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.040
And Book likes sunflowers so much…

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.320
He even hung them in his room.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.600
So you two really liked each other, right.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.880
About that?

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.240
That picture was

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.840
the cover photo for a column.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.080
That he wrote for me.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.160
He said

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.320
he liked when

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:10.000
someone had feelings for the one they love.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.280
Like the meaning of that flower.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.720
Midnight Sunflower.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.240
A flower that blooms

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.040
even in the darkest times.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.160
Like a love that stays beautiful…

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.520
Even in the deepest night.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.240
No matter how far apart two people are…

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.080
The love they once had…

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.000
It never changes.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.920
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.200
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.760
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.840
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.280
A love that remains beautiful

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.840
even in the darkness.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.760
Is the meaning of the flower called…

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.240
Midnight Sunflower.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.080
How did you know that?

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.600
Didn’t you say you like this flower.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.160
You remembered?

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.480
You also read this magazine?

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.360
Yeah.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.080
I once wrote a letter to someone.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.960
Through a column in that magazine.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.960
Same for me.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.600
Full Moon Night

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.600
and Mr. Sunshine.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.040
Wait.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.200
Good night,

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.040
I hope we meet again tomorrow.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.440
You..

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.760
You were the one who sent letters to me.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.720
When I was in therapy for gender dysphoria?

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.200
Yeah.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.720
What a crazy coincidence.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.760
Do you know…

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.960
Your letters…

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.480
They meant everything to me.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.440
Back then I didn’t want to live anymore.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.440
I didn’t even

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.240
want to open my eyes to breathe.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.120
My whole world was dark.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.840
But because of your letters…

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.200
I wanted to stay alive.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.880
I’m…

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.800
Happy.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
So happy.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.200
Thank you.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.200
Come on.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.480
Let’s play in the water.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.360
No, I don’t want to get wet.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.480
Hey.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.320
Don’t.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.040
I’ll get wet.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.160
Come on, let’s play in the water.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.360
No, I’ll get wet.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.720
Hey.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.120
Isn't he afraid of getting AIDS or what?

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.000
Yeah, since when did they get so close?

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.840
Ugh,

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.720
gross!

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.200
(I.)

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.720
(I love.)

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.000
(I love you.)

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.680
(What about you?)

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.320
(I.)

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.320
(I love.)

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.160
(I love you.)

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.760
So beautiful.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.160
What is it?

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.240
Do you know Li Bai?

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.280
He’s the poet who rowed out to catch the moon.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.200
Li Bai rowed out

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.240
and saw the reflection of the moon on the water.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.640
Sparkling.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.800
So he wanted to possess the moon.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.720
And he jumped into the water to grab it.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.120
In the end he died.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.360
Because in reality…

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.600
The moon is in the sky,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.480
not the reflection in the water.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.040
Who would be stupid enough to

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.520
reach for the moon in the water and die.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.960
Only drunk people.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.760
You don’t understand the beauty of the story at all.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.360
It’s because

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.040
Li Bai loved the moon so much.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.080
Even if he couldn’t have it…

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.320
At least

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.280
he tried.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.080
People who give

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.080
everything for what they believe in…

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.640
It’s romantic.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.760
Well then…

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.920
I’ll take good care of it.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.640
Thank you.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.639
Hey.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.320
Are you messing with me?

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:41.320
How?

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.920
When you hang clothes you have to shake them.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.400
Hey.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.719
Getting revenge?

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.080
So you want to do this?

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.960
Fine.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.240
Where are you going!

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.160
Come here!

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.840
Mom.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.480
Don’t.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.680
Don’t, don’t.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.120
I’ve wanted to tell you for a long time but.. Stop!

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.560
I didn’t see anything!

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.360
Mom, Seen and I love each other.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.120
How dare you admit it?!

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.200
How dare you say?!

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.600
That you love him?

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.560
Do you want to see me die?

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.160
Do you want to see me go insane?

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.120
Mom,

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.880
Seen and I just love each other.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.440
Stop arguing!

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.400
Remember this,

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.800
if you insist on loving him…

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.840
Don’t call me your mother.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.000
Ahh!

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.600
Go then!

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.360
I’m not going!

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.320
Go! Let go!

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.760
Go!

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.200
Go!

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.440
Dad!

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.440
I’m not going!

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.200
Dad, do I really have to go?

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.000
Dad! I don't want to go.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.200
Seen!

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.840
Hey!

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.120
What the hell are you doing?

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.800
Seen.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.160
Seen!

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.160
Where are you taking him?

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:09.640
Seen!

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.520
Seen!

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.600
Seen!

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.720
Cut!

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.640
Scene seven, take two.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.360
Next scene?

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.200
I liked it.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.000
I think Saint did a great job.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:33.840
Very good.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.040
Saint was terrific.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:35.720
How was it?

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.560
Ok.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.880
Great.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.880
You were so great.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.800
Lanee?

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.360
Is there any scene you want to change?

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.240
What about the kiss scene?

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.040
By the clothesline, right?

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:49.640
Yeah.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.760
Ah okay.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.040
Alright then, since we still have plenty of time.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.800
So we…

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.840
I want to go back and shoot

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.680
the kissing scene at the clothesline.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.840
Where Choon walks in.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.000
Because when you kissed back then.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.800
You two looked so hesitant.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.400
Is that okay?

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.640
Yes. Yes.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.640
Very good.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.040
But this time

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.360
I want it to feel more intense than before.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.360
And make it hotter.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.760
Mm.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.760
Try kissing like

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.840
you’ve wanted to kiss each other for a long time.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.160
The vibe of filling in all the moments.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.480
When we used to hold back in the past.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.200
Okay?

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.800
Mm.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.480
Ready?

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.640
If you’re ready then.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.720
Three.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.520
Two.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.640
One.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:40.480
Action.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.320
Kiss more intensely.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Kit slowly takes off Seen’s shirt.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.200
What is that, Khem?

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.560
What are they doing?! Kaew,

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.960
they’re shooting a porn film.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.360
Porn film?

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.120
Yes.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.800
What are you doing?

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.160
Mom?

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.600
Ice.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.960
You’re acting in porn to make money?

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.160
Mom?

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.760
I’m not.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.120
I can see it clearly.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.120
Are you

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.440
intentionally using Uncle Pakorn’s rental house

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.240
as a location to shoot porn?

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.600
This is Uncle Pakorn’s rental house?

00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.560
Yes.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.040
Why are you acting like this.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.640
Can you stop shooting porn?

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.440
Please.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.760
Mom,

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.240
I’m not shooting porn anymore.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.480
And I didn’t know this was Uncle Pakorn’s house.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.840
I’m just shooting a short film.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.760
Don’t lie to me.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.600
I’m not lying.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:20.840
If you don’t believe me,

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.000
go check the front of the house.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.000
Are you sure?

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.200
It’s just that… there might be a love scene or two.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.120
Believe me.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.240
Are you short on money or something.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.240
Give me your bank number, I’ll transfer you some.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.320
Mom, I have money.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.160
I’m not doing everything just for money anymore.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.720
Give me your bank number.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.280
And use this money to take care of your father.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.160
Mom…

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.320
Dad is gone.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:20.840
You…

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.040
You…

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:23.880
What do you mean?

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.760
What are you saying?

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.840
Back then

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.480
when I had to shoot porn,

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.960
it was because I had no choice.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
I had to pay off Dad’s debt.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.600
Then why didn’t you tell me?

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.280
Didn't you tell me not to contact you?

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.160
(Can I stay by your side quietly.)

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.640
I feel so terrible.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:19.480
For walking out and leaving Mom crying alone.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.680
But I couldn’t handle it either.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.840
Do you think I was that wrong?

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.160
No.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.040
Everyone has the right to not be okay.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.920
And to walk away.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.560
You know…

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.800
Since the day Mom told me

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.200
not to contact anyone.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.440
I never talked to her again.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:03.280
Happy birthday to you.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.920
Happy birthday to you.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:13.640
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:18.520
Happy birthday to you.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.000
Thank you.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.200
Happy birthday, son.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.000
I wish you to be the happiest kid in the world.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.840
Make a wish, Ice.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.000
And blow the candles.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.080
Here.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.680
Oh.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.080
Uh…

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.200
What cake is this?

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.280
What is this?

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:45.680
Uh…

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.240
What.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.920
It’s our son's birthday.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.040
You should’ve bought me booze!! Ah!

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.800
Not bought me a damn cake! Ugh.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.760
You…

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.840
Ugh. You need to be punished!

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.360
Dad no!

00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.200
What?

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.200
Did you hit my kid!

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.240
Did you hit me, you bitch! Ah!

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.040
Ah!

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:05.680
Don’t!

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.640
Die!

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.640
Get out of my house right now.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.560
Get out.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.480
Go! Ice, go!

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:11.880
Hey, you don’t get to take your kid!

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.400
He's mine!

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.680
Go alone, Kaew!

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.600
If you take my kid.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.920
I’ll shoot every last one of you.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.280
Get out.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.040
I’m going.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.320
Ice,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.280
listen to me.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.200
When you grow up.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.520
Work and save money

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.480
and run away from here.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.640
Don’t you ever submit to that bastard!

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.280
What the hell are you saying, Kaew?

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.440
Drop dead!

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.720
Damn it!

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.640
Don't listen to your mother!

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.480
Listen to me!

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.800
I'm your fucking father!

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.840
What the fuck you looking at?!

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.400
Fuck!

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.800
It’s because of me.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.360
It’s all because of me, I’m bad luck.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.320
No.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.960
Don’t think like that.

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.320
You’re not bad luck or anything like that.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.840
Stop thinking this way.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:23.880
From now on

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.640
you cannot blame yourself anymore.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.920
Promise?

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.880
You don’t have to be afraid of anything now.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.600
If you can’t handle it.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.400
You still have me right here.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.880
I’ll be the one holding you whenever you cry.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.480
From now on…

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.440
I’ll stay by your side.

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.800
Okay.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.560
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.560
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.880
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.920
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.040
You're so brave,

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.160
I've give you a reward.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.560
I'm going to take you out.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.160
Ok?

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.640
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:32.600
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.880
So Lanee and Saint,

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.800
are they together?

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.600
My daughter is dating Sea.

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.200
Did my dad order you to continue following me around?

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.600
I'm really sorry.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.600
I don't really want to do this.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.640
Go take a shower.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.040
I'll take you there tomorrow.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.520
The money that you sent me.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.120
I've always kept it away in another account.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.960
So that you don't have to go through anymore hardships.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.320
From now on,

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.520
can I take on the role as your boyfriend?
