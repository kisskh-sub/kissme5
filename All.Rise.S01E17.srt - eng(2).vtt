(Talent Hunt Program Day 57)

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.832
(Li Ke: 4, Guo Xiaoyu: 3, Yan Fei: 2,
Ren Jiatong: 1, Jiang Chen: 1)

00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:01.996
Master Jiang?

00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:06.076
This is my colleague.

00:02:06.675 --> 00:02:07.175
May I?

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:07.856
Yes?

00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:12.316
Mr. Jiang.

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:13.175
Hello.

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:14.395
I'm Guo Xiaoyu.

00:02:14.796 --> 00:02:15.675
Like Jiang Chen,

00:02:15.675 --> 00:02:17.435
I'm also part
of the Talent Hunt Program.

00:02:18.636 --> 00:02:20.756
I'm a huge fan of yours.

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:22.275
I've featured you before

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:23.155
on my video channel.

00:02:23.356 --> 00:02:24.636
Everyone calls you

00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:25.640
Master Jiang.

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:28.495
- May I have your signature?
- Sure.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:29.316
Of course.

00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:30.375
Thank you.

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:32.036
It's Ren Jiatong's notebook, isn't it?

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:33.275
Your dad is a Legal God?

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:33.956
Tight-lipped.

00:02:37.196 --> 00:02:38.995
He never told you people

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:39.835
I'm his dad?

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:41.215
He didn't.

00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:48.675
Get that girl earlier as well.

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:50.155
I'm treating you all.

00:02:50.595 --> 00:02:51.356
You pick the place.

00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:52.916
Get whatever you want.

00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:54.055
Okay.

00:02:55.115 --> 00:02:56.275
Jiatong, come quick.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:58.155
He wants to treat us to dinner.

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:00.715
I'll pass.

00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:01.756
I'm tired.

00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:03.516
Then come back to Chongqing with me.

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:05.196
My firm isn't big on rules.

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:08.236
Dating in particular.

00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:09.595
It's very free.

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:15.756
Mr. Jiang, let's treat you.

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:16.995
If you don't mind,

00:03:16.995 --> 00:03:18.595
we'll take you to this small restaurant.

00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:20.715
It's Jiang Chen and our favorite spot.

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:21.435
It's downstairs.

00:03:22.155 --> 00:03:22.655
Not at all.

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:24.375
Let's go.

00:03:25.155 --> 00:03:25.655
This way.

00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:33.236
Why'd you have to invite him?

00:03:34.196 --> 00:03:36.196
All this over instant noodles?

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:38.476
And Xiaoyu too.

00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:40.595
"Legal God! Master Jiang!"

00:03:40.995 --> 00:03:41.495
Shut up.

00:03:43.516 --> 00:03:45.036
Is having dinner with me this hard?

00:03:55.715 --> 00:03:56.555
Jiatong, you're here.

00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:57.275
(Noodles)
Ma'am.

00:03:58.236 --> 00:03:58.736
Here.

00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:00.476
Try these tangerines first.

00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:03.275
My folks brought them
from home, super sweet.

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:04.516
Noodles are almost ready.

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:05.516
Wait a second.

00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:06.196
Thank you.

00:04:06.196 --> 00:04:06.696
Thank you.

00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:07.715
Let me help you.

00:04:08.175 --> 00:04:08.675
Alright.

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:09.275
Sweetie.

00:04:10.476 --> 00:04:11.555
No milk for you today.

00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:14.275
Mr. Jiang, the puppy's named Sweetie.

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:15.356
We all adore him.

00:04:17.516 --> 00:04:18.116
But,

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:19.355
we never dare hold him

00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:20.996
when we're in our good clothes.

00:04:21.316 --> 00:04:22.632
Or we'll end up covered in fur.

00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:23.996
I remember once

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:26.196
I wore the coat my dad gave me,

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.676
a gift for my 17th birthday.

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:30.436
Kind of my nicest outfit.

00:04:30.876 --> 00:04:31.636
After I held him,

00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:33.035
I was completely furry.

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:35.196
I used sticky rollers on it.

00:04:35.196 --> 00:04:37.076
It took me forever to clean the fur off.

00:04:37.475 --> 00:04:38.952
Using sticky rollers for dog hair?

00:04:39.116 --> 00:04:39.636
It's not like

00:04:39.636 --> 00:04:41.475
something kids your age would do.

00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:42.915
Ask Jiang Chen.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:43.956
He knows it too.

00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:45.756
He lived overseas.

00:04:45.835 --> 00:04:46.715
I'm a Beijing drifter.

00:04:47.076 --> 00:04:49.355
We pick up these little life hacks.

00:04:50.275 --> 00:04:53.116
I've known so little
about my son all these years.

00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:58.915
Chen's childhood dog
was also named Sweetie.

00:05:04.316 --> 00:05:05.835
Back when we first joined Jun An,

00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:08.556
everyone wore their finest clothes.

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:10.715
Then we realized that it would be

00:05:10.715 --> 00:05:11.835
endless subway crushes,

00:05:12.116 --> 00:05:13.715
burnout, and takeout.

00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:15.756
Scrapes and stains
happened all the time.

00:05:16.275 --> 00:05:18.956
Slowly, we stopped wearing nice clothes.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:20.235
Ask Jiang Chen.

00:05:20.475 --> 00:05:21.956
Those nice outfits you bought him?

00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:23.155
He probably won't wear them.

00:05:23.436 --> 00:05:24.235
He cherishes them.

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:27.035
Noodles are ready.

00:05:29.756 --> 00:05:30.256
Here you go.

00:05:30.436 --> 00:05:32.116
It's your first visit. Try our noodles.

00:05:32.835 --> 00:05:33.355
Thank you.

00:05:33.795 --> 00:05:34.516
Where's the owner?

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:36.295
Thanks.

00:05:40.076 --> 00:05:40.676
Mr. Jiang,

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:43.436
this is where we usually eat.

00:05:43.795 --> 00:05:44.835
We're showing you

00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:47.355
so you won't worry
about Jiang Chen's daily life.

00:05:47.636 --> 00:05:48.516
When we work overtime

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:49.956
or have free time, we eat here.

00:05:49.956 --> 00:05:50.676
It's delicious.

00:05:50.676 --> 00:05:51.275
Please try it.

00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:53.715
For the restaurant you mentioned,

00:05:54.116 --> 00:05:56.676
we'd love to experience it
with you another day.

00:05:57.155 --> 00:05:58.835
But today, try this first.

00:05:59.316 --> 00:06:01.636
Consider this our Michelin-starred meal.

00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:10.176
Tasty.

00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:13.636
Much better than that Michelin place
I mentioned.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:17.640
Ending the lease?

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:19.756
You can't just end the lease.

00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:20.516
You have no right.

00:06:20.636 --> 00:06:22.275
Our lease extends
to the year after next.

00:06:22.876 --> 00:06:24.395
You know I just renovated

00:06:24.595 --> 00:06:25.835
this place.

00:06:26.076 --> 00:06:27.436
That's against the law.

00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:27.996
Do you know?

00:06:28.715 --> 00:06:29.715
We own this property.

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:30.756
The final say

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:31.436
is ours.

00:06:31.756 --> 00:06:32.595
You're one to talk!

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:33.676
Read the lease.

00:06:33.676 --> 00:06:34.316
Let's talk.

00:06:34.316 --> 00:06:35.155
- Be reasonable.
- Let's go over there.

00:06:35.155 --> 00:06:35.835
Let's go there.

00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:37.835
Right. We should...

00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:38.636
Ridiculous.

00:06:42.355 --> 00:06:43.196
Earlier

00:06:43.996 --> 00:06:45.835
I saw what was in that notebook.

00:06:47.116 --> 00:06:49.316
I suspect you care deeply
about Jiang Chen.

00:06:49.795 --> 00:06:50.876
That notebook

00:06:50.996 --> 00:06:53.116
documents every professional move
Jiang Chen made

00:06:53.116 --> 00:06:54.116
since joining Jun An.

00:06:54.556 --> 00:06:55.516
Why keep such records?

00:07:00.475 --> 00:07:01.235
To be honest,

00:07:01.996 --> 00:07:02.956
since childhood,

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:05.076
few peers could outperform me.

00:07:06.475 --> 00:07:07.556
But Jiang Chen is one.

00:07:09.076 --> 00:07:11.116
So during each notebook review,

00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:11.915
I record

00:07:11.956 --> 00:07:14.116
every strategic point where we compete.

00:07:14.876 --> 00:07:16.235
Can I infer you showed me

00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:18.715
that notebook on purpose?

00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:19.855
Why?

00:07:20.835 --> 00:07:21.956
Because I wanted you to know

00:07:22.996 --> 00:07:24.516
Jiang Chen is exceptionally talented.

00:07:25.116 --> 00:07:27.395
He'll become an outstanding lawyer.

00:07:28.556 --> 00:07:30.035
How accomplished my son will become

00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:32.355
is something I already foresee.

00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:35.235
Does he know you're so proud of him?

00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:38.395
Precisely because I'm proud,

00:07:38.556 --> 00:07:40.116
I'm bringing him back to Chongqing.

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:42.076
If he fails to recognize that,

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.196
he's unfit for legal practice.

00:07:45.835 --> 00:07:46.516
Mr. Jiang,

00:07:46.835 --> 00:07:48.116
Jiang Chen takes after you.

00:07:48.395 --> 00:07:48.895
Is that so?

00:07:54.956 --> 00:07:56.116
Haven't you considered

00:07:56.595 --> 00:07:57.996
he might not want to return?

00:07:59.795 --> 00:08:01.196
Bringing him back to Chongqing

00:08:01.756 --> 00:08:03.595
actually benefits you most.

00:08:04.436 --> 00:08:06.395
I disagree, Mr. Jiang.

00:08:06.956 --> 00:08:08.516
After raising such an exceptional son

00:08:08.516 --> 00:08:10.275
with such effort,

00:08:10.516 --> 00:08:12.235
watching him work for another firm

00:08:12.556 --> 00:08:14.316
and potentially oppose you
in court someday

00:08:14.636 --> 00:08:16.795
would upset anyone.

00:08:17.035 --> 00:08:18.395
But taking Jiang Chen away

00:08:18.756 --> 00:08:20.395
still primarily benefits you.

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:23.915
Your logic is sound.

00:08:24.996 --> 00:08:27.035
Jiang Chen's return to Chongqing
is another matter.

00:08:27.556 --> 00:08:29.715
But I'd wholeheartedly
welcome you to join our firm.

00:08:30.035 --> 00:08:31.475
Soon, I'll open a branch in Beijing.

00:08:32.036 --> 00:08:33.235
I'll definitely give you

00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:34.556
an exciting offer.

00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:37.235
Thank you, Uncle Jiang.

00:08:37.676 --> 00:08:38.635
I mean, Mr. Jiang.

00:08:39.156 --> 00:08:40.396
- You're welcome.
- I've asked.

00:08:41.515 --> 00:08:42.916
The property management

00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:44.036
handles all the storefronts.

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:45.916
The lease hasn't expired yet.

00:08:46.076 --> 00:08:47.475
But the management wants to end it.

00:08:48.076 --> 00:08:50.076
The original contract didn't specify,

00:08:50.515 --> 00:08:51.156
so

00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:52.676
the management refuses to pay

00:08:52.676 --> 00:08:53.956
renovation fees or penalties.

00:08:54.396 --> 00:08:55.396
Those people earlier

00:08:55.396 --> 00:08:56.635
were likely sent by them.

00:08:57.475 --> 00:09:00.276
Then tell the shop owner
to get the contract

00:09:00.276 --> 00:09:01.515
and other paperwork ready.

00:09:02.156 --> 00:09:03.475
Someone must be jealous

00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:04.916
of the noodle shop's business.

00:09:05.036 --> 00:09:06.316
That's their motive.

00:09:07.115 --> 00:09:08.115
Set up contingency plans.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:09.835
Minimize the losses.

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:10.615
Understood.

00:09:12.595 --> 00:09:13.635
Xiaoyu is negotiating.

00:09:16.595 --> 00:09:17.635
Your noodles must be cold.

00:09:17.635 --> 00:09:18.956
I'll get you a fresh bowl.

00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:21.355
Have a drink with your dad first.

00:09:22.115 --> 00:09:22.615
Thank you.

00:09:57.436 --> 00:09:58.196
I remember

00:09:59.196 --> 00:10:00.355
we last drank during your

00:10:00.355 --> 00:10:01.676
college entrance exams.

00:10:02.396 --> 00:10:02.896
Yes.

00:10:04.115 --> 00:10:05.235
You banned me from law.

00:10:06.676 --> 00:10:07.755
And I failed the exams

00:10:08.755 --> 00:10:10.956
and derailed the bright future
you planned for me.

00:10:11.755 --> 00:10:12.255
Son,

00:10:13.316 --> 00:10:13.916
do you know

00:10:14.475 --> 00:10:16.115
why I didn't want you
to become a lawyer?

00:10:17.115 --> 00:10:17.615
No idea.

00:10:18.355 --> 00:10:18.916
I'm unworthy?

00:10:19.316 --> 00:10:19.995
Nonsense.

00:10:21.436 --> 00:10:23.635
If my son isn't worthy, who is?

00:10:24.316 --> 00:10:25.635
Why would you ever think that?

00:10:27.156 --> 00:10:27.796
Then why?

00:10:30.676 --> 00:10:31.176
Son,

00:10:32.196 --> 00:10:33.316
the legal profession

00:10:34.396 --> 00:10:35.396
is brutal.

00:10:35.595 --> 00:10:36.835
Endless late nights,

00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:38.316
constant travel

00:10:38.796 --> 00:10:39.875
and irregular meals.

00:10:40.396 --> 00:10:41.916
Even the toughest body

00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:44.235
breaks down after two or three decades.

00:10:44.796 --> 00:10:46.676
I saw your director, Mr. Zhuang, today.

00:10:46.916 --> 00:10:49.595
His physical state
resembles mine right now.

00:10:50.156 --> 00:10:52.076
And he bears tremendous pressure.

00:10:52.515 --> 00:10:53.396
I've endured

00:10:53.995 --> 00:10:55.036
all this suffering myself.

00:10:56.076 --> 00:10:57.156
I couldn't bear

00:10:58.076 --> 00:10:59.235
to watch you endure the same.

00:11:00.475 --> 00:11:02.036
I kept you away from the law before,

00:11:02.715 --> 00:11:04.196
and I'm asking you to return with me

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:05.835
simply because

00:11:05.835 --> 00:11:07.515
I want your life to be easier.

00:11:09.156 --> 00:11:09.656
Son,

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:12.396
I've failed you as a father all along.

00:11:13.316 --> 00:11:14.595
But everything I did

00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:16.396
was for your own good.

00:11:17.316 --> 00:11:18.995
What I want most now is for you

00:11:19.436 --> 00:11:20.916
to not become a lawyer

00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:22.875
just to spite me.

00:11:24.635 --> 00:11:25.995
Why won't you believe

00:11:25.995 --> 00:11:28.436
that I genuinely want to be a lawyer?

00:11:29.076 --> 00:11:31.556
I might've been impulsive at the start.

00:11:31.556 --> 00:11:32.676
But I'm not anymore.

00:11:33.515 --> 00:11:35.475
I just helped that noodle shop owner

00:11:35.475 --> 00:11:36.715
solve a very simple

00:11:36.715 --> 00:11:37.796
legal problem.

00:11:38.076 --> 00:11:38.796
It makes me happy.

00:11:38.796 --> 00:11:39.715
I feel fulfilled.

00:11:40.156 --> 00:11:40.956
And now I understand

00:11:40.956 --> 00:11:43.316
what all those legal provisions
I memorized mean

00:11:43.316 --> 00:11:44.835
and how they're actually applied.

00:11:45.495 --> 00:11:45.995
But...

00:11:45.995 --> 00:11:47.475
But you just refuse to believe me.

00:11:47.796 --> 00:11:48.995
And you won't even try.

00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:50.956
If you gave me just one-tenth

00:11:50.956 --> 00:11:52.115
of your attention, patience,

00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:52.995
or curiosity

00:11:53.235 --> 00:11:53.956
with your clients,

00:11:54.156 --> 00:11:55.676
you'd know me better than this.

00:11:55.995 --> 00:11:57.956
I'm taking time to sit with you here now

00:11:57.956 --> 00:12:00.436
because I want to understand you.

00:12:00.635 --> 00:12:01.436
Isn't it normal

00:12:01.436 --> 00:12:02.556
for a father and son

00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:03.556
to have a meal together?

00:12:03.995 --> 00:12:05.715
Why must it be "taking time" for me?

00:12:06.076 --> 00:12:07.635
Am I wasting your precious time?

00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:08.456
I'm sorry.

00:12:09.316 --> 00:12:09.816
I'm sorry.

00:12:10.235 --> 00:12:12.715
Son, that's not what I meant.

00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:14.916
I heard everything you said.

00:12:15.396 --> 00:12:16.556
I know you mean well.

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.156
But some wounds

00:12:18.156 --> 00:12:19.956
took me a very long time

00:12:19.956 --> 00:12:21.916
to slowly heal.

00:12:22.115 --> 00:12:23.635
As an adult

00:12:23.635 --> 00:12:24.475
or a young man

00:12:24.676 --> 00:12:25.835
who studied law,

00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:28.036
I understand every decision you made,

00:12:28.276 --> 00:12:29.595
every word you said to me,

00:12:29.755 --> 00:12:31.475
and every lesson
you taught me back then.

00:12:31.676 --> 00:12:32.956
But I didn't get it as a child.

00:12:33.436 --> 00:12:34.916
Besides being your son,

00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:36.076
I'm also my mom's son.

00:12:36.276 --> 00:12:37.396
And I feel sorry for her.

00:12:37.595 --> 00:12:38.995
She was the one who sent me abroad.

00:12:38.995 --> 00:12:40.515
She gave me another chance,

00:12:40.715 --> 00:12:42.235
allowing me into this profession.

00:12:45.276 --> 00:12:46.475
I can't go with you.

00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:48.235
I want to stay at Jun An.

00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:50.036
I've already made the decision.

00:12:50.196 --> 00:12:51.196
Can you respect it?

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:57.692
(Noodles)

00:13:01.755 --> 00:13:02.515
That girl is good.

00:13:02.796 --> 00:13:03.475
Cherish her.

00:13:06.156 --> 00:13:06.656
Son,

00:13:07.796 --> 00:13:08.436
you've grown up.

00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:10.396
You decide your own path now.

00:13:11.036 --> 00:13:11.835
But remember this:

00:13:11.995 --> 00:13:13.396
You are my son.

00:13:13.956 --> 00:13:14.515
Don't lose.

00:13:16.316 --> 00:13:16.816
I know.

00:13:17.676 --> 00:13:18.176
I'm off.

00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:28.056
Mr. Jiang.

00:13:39.715 --> 00:13:40.215
Go for it.

00:14:24.316 --> 00:14:24.995
Don't worry.

00:14:25.396 --> 00:14:26.316
We didn't see anything.

00:14:26.436 --> 00:14:26.936
Right?

00:14:29.515 --> 00:14:30.436
Were you crying?

00:14:30.515 --> 00:14:31.515
No, I was sweating.

00:14:43.035 --> 00:14:44.095
(New email)

00:14:44.095 --> 00:14:46.216
(Subject: Round 5
Overall Scores and Rankings)

(Overall Ranking: 3)

00:15:18.396 --> 00:15:18.956
Mr. Zhou,

00:15:19.436 --> 00:15:20.635
(Overall Ranking: 4)
my ranking is on the edge now.

00:15:21.676 --> 00:15:23.076
Days remain in this round.

00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:25.036
Could you help me with that?

00:15:36.076 --> 00:15:36.595
Ke,

00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:39.036
no matter how busy you are,
eat well, sleep well,

00:15:39.196 --> 00:15:39.995
and exercise.

00:15:40.796 --> 00:15:41.556
Don't stay up late.

00:15:42.196 --> 00:15:42.696
By the way.

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:43.956
The fresh walnuts I sent

00:15:43.995 --> 00:15:45.396
were all cracked by your sister.

00:15:45.635 --> 00:15:46.276
Eat them soon.

00:15:52.956 --> 00:15:54.276
This round still has a week left.

00:15:54.436 --> 00:15:55.475
Until the last moment,

00:15:55.556 --> 00:15:57.076
nobody knows who gets eliminated.

00:15:57.595 --> 00:15:58.635
Seize every opportunity.

00:15:58.995 --> 00:16:00.796
Now let me brief you
on the current situation.

00:16:01.316 --> 00:16:03.475
Jiang Chen has some personal matters

00:16:03.715 --> 00:16:04.796
and can't continue

00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:06.436
the follow-up on the RE case.

00:16:07.076 --> 00:16:08.676
Mr. Song and I have decided

00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:11.515
that Jiang Chen's work
will transfer to Guo Xiaoyu.

00:16:13.956 --> 00:16:15.676
Thank you for this opportunity.

00:16:16.156 --> 00:16:17.916
You earned this through your own effort.

00:16:18.316 --> 00:16:19.875
Mr. Song was pleased with your document

00:16:19.956 --> 00:16:20.475
last night.

00:16:20.755 --> 00:16:21.255
I saw it too.

00:16:21.835 --> 00:16:22.556
Notable progress.

00:16:23.355 --> 00:16:24.115
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

00:16:24.676 --> 00:16:25.176
Jiang Chen,

00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:26.835
given your great performance,

00:16:27.076 --> 00:16:29.436
Mr. Song specifically requested you
as his assistant

00:16:29.515 --> 00:16:30.635
to handle

00:16:30.635 --> 00:16:32.196
Tian Kai Xin's remaining projects.

00:16:34.475 --> 00:16:35.835
I have a task from Ms. Bai too.

00:16:36.156 --> 00:16:36.676
I can do it.

00:16:38.475 --> 00:16:39.515
It is time-sensitive.

00:16:39.715 --> 00:16:41.036
You three all need to work on it.

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:42.076
The top performer

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:43.635
will earn points

00:16:44.316 --> 00:16:45.276
and get

00:16:45.276 --> 00:16:46.475
a business trip with Ms. Bai.

00:16:47.556 --> 00:16:48.715
Even I'm tempted by this.

00:16:49.316 --> 00:16:50.515
Don't overextend yourself.

00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:52.436
Focus on your current work first.

00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:54.156
Make sure you survive this round.

00:16:54.835 --> 00:16:56.796
Jiang Chen, you should
follow Mr. Zhou's advice.

00:16:57.076 --> 00:16:58.316
Because this opportunity

00:16:58.835 --> 00:16:59.835
is for me to take.

00:17:38.596 --> 00:17:40.075
Hello, thank you for meeting me.

00:17:40.196 --> 00:17:40.715
Hello.

00:17:41.275 --> 00:17:41.775
Please sit.

00:17:55.548 --> 00:17:56.552
(Equity Transfer Agreement)

00:17:56.552 --> 00:17:58.521
(Shareholder Capital
Contribution Agreement)

00:18:04.396 --> 00:18:06.715
Both parties agreed on a thirty percent

00:18:06.715 --> 00:18:09.515
and seventy percent co-investment ratio,

00:18:10.555 --> 00:18:11.235
(Client: Hong Da)
totaling 100 million yuan.

00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:16.254
(New Company)

00:18:19.067 --> 00:18:21.480
(Xin Jian)

00:18:25.628 --> 00:18:28.596
(Third Party, Client: Hong Da.
Xin Jian Ye: ¥45M. New Company: ¥50M)

00:18:28.596 --> 00:18:29.396
Alright, I see.

00:18:31.075 --> 00:18:31.795
I'll

00:18:31.795 --> 00:18:33.396
be available after 8 PM tomorrow.

00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:34.656
Okay.

00:18:35.676 --> 00:18:36.176
Ms. Bai.

00:18:37.636 --> 00:18:38.136
Come on in.

00:18:42.075 --> 00:18:43.156
Here are my thoughts

00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:45.715
on asset preservation for this case.

00:18:49.515 --> 00:18:50.015
Go ahead.

00:18:50.676 --> 00:18:51.995
Regardless of the finalized

00:18:51.995 --> 00:18:53.596
arbitration strategy,

00:18:53.755 --> 00:18:54.916
our client, as the claimant,

00:18:54.916 --> 00:18:56.755
must file property preservation

00:18:56.755 --> 00:18:58.356
against Hong Da.

00:18:58.555 --> 00:18:59.275
This ensures

00:18:59.275 --> 00:19:01.315
that if we win arbitration,
recovery is feasible.

00:19:01.636 --> 00:19:03.156
So, when initiating arbitration,

00:19:03.156 --> 00:19:04.755
we should petition the tribunal

00:19:04.755 --> 00:19:06.755
for asset preservation measures
against Hong Da,

00:19:07.475 --> 00:19:09.995
such as freezing their accounts
and equity holdings

00:19:10.075 --> 00:19:11.624
and seizing vehicle and other assets.

00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:12.515
Be direct.

00:19:12.808 --> 00:19:14.235
These are the conventional methods.

00:19:14.235 --> 00:19:16.156
But I noticed Hong Da

00:19:16.235 --> 00:19:17.596
is in the clothing business.

00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:19.715
If we can target Hong Da's

00:19:19.715 --> 00:19:21.315
main registered trademarks

00:19:21.315 --> 00:19:22.475
for successful preservation,

00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:23.916
we could obtain execution funds

00:19:24.156 --> 00:19:26.196
by auctioning off
those preserved trademarks later

00:19:26.196 --> 00:19:27.075
to secure payment.

00:19:27.795 --> 00:19:28.315
Good.

00:19:29.116 --> 00:19:30.876
How long did you spend preparing these?

00:19:31.715 --> 00:19:32.396
Under three days.

00:19:33.515 --> 00:19:34.555
That's quite efficient.

00:19:37.235 --> 00:19:37.735
Here,

00:19:38.156 --> 00:19:38.995
read this document.

00:19:39.356 --> 00:19:40.396
After reading it,

00:19:40.436 --> 00:19:41.836
share your thoughts with me.

00:19:49.396 --> 00:19:50.876
It also uses property preservation

00:19:50.876 --> 00:19:51.916
as its core strategy.

00:19:52.035 --> 00:19:53.436
She discovered Hong Da

00:19:53.436 --> 00:19:54.636
has ongoing business

00:19:54.636 --> 00:19:55.916
with another company.

00:19:56.275 --> 00:19:57.995
That company owes Hong Da

00:19:57.995 --> 00:19:59.836
three million yuan in overdue payments.

00:19:59.956 --> 00:20:01.356
The debt has matured but is unpaid.

00:20:01.356 --> 00:20:03.116
She proposes preserving Hong Da's

00:20:03.116 --> 00:20:05.035
matured creditor rights
against that company.

00:20:05.436 --> 00:20:07.475
After winning the case, our client

00:20:07.475 --> 00:20:08.956
could directly collect that payment.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.596
Between her approach and yours,

00:20:11.596 --> 00:20:12.275
which is better?

00:20:13.956 --> 00:20:14.836
Yan Fei's is great.

00:20:15.156 --> 00:20:16.075
But mine holds up well.

00:20:16.795 --> 00:20:18.676
Combining our approaches

00:20:18.715 --> 00:20:20.156
gives the client the best solution.

00:20:20.436 --> 00:20:21.995
How did you know Yan Fei did it?

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:23.676
This business intel requires

00:20:23.916 --> 00:20:25.515
her family's unique connections

00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:26.715
to uncover.

00:20:27.156 --> 00:20:27.876
You're smart.

00:20:28.596 --> 00:20:29.916
But you seem reluctant.

00:20:30.715 --> 00:20:32.396
Feeling her success relies on resources,

00:20:32.715 --> 00:20:33.676
and it's unfair?

00:20:34.636 --> 00:20:36.475
Ms. Bai, I'm not a child.

00:20:36.636 --> 00:20:37.715
I don't feel that way.

00:20:37.916 --> 00:20:39.356
I work within my strengths

00:20:39.356 --> 00:20:40.315
and do what I can.

00:20:41.995 --> 00:20:44.075
But currently,

00:20:44.116 --> 00:20:46.116
her approach appears superior.

00:20:47.176 --> 00:20:47.676
Ms. Bai...

00:20:47.676 --> 00:20:48.956
Remember what Zhou Nian said

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:50.436
during the assignment briefing?

00:20:50.836 --> 00:20:52.876
He said your work progress

00:20:53.116 --> 00:20:54.596
should be reported directly to me.

00:20:55.596 --> 00:20:56.096
I remember.

00:20:56.676 --> 00:20:58.396
That's why I've been waiting
since morning.

00:20:58.755 --> 00:21:00.035
Then why didn't you

00:21:00.035 --> 00:21:01.515
approach me once in three days?

00:21:01.876 --> 00:21:03.116
You started immediately

00:21:03.116 --> 00:21:04.035
after receiving the job

00:21:04.035 --> 00:21:05.916
and submitted it now after three days.

00:21:06.196 --> 00:21:08.676
Compared to most junior lawyers,

00:21:08.676 --> 00:21:09.555
you're much faster.

00:21:09.876 --> 00:21:12.075
But if your approach needs an overhaul

00:21:12.075 --> 00:21:13.396
due to foundational flaws,

00:21:13.515 --> 00:21:14.916
and the client inquiries

00:21:14.916 --> 00:21:15.715
about progress,

00:21:15.956 --> 00:21:17.636
what should we tell them?

00:21:19.596 --> 00:21:21.235
Want to know Yan Fei's method?

00:21:21.995 --> 00:21:22.636
First,

00:21:22.636 --> 00:21:24.836
she drafted
a property preservation outline.

00:21:25.235 --> 00:21:26.035
She sent it to me

00:21:26.196 --> 00:21:27.755
and scheduled a meeting for day two.

00:21:28.196 --> 00:21:29.995
When I didn't respond during court,

00:21:30.275 --> 00:21:32.116
she developed the method further

00:21:32.356 --> 00:21:34.035
and scheduled another meeting
on day three.

00:21:34.235 --> 00:21:35.916
So before I met you today,

00:21:35.916 --> 00:21:37.156
she'd already presented

00:21:37.396 --> 00:21:39.596
her work progress and results

00:21:39.876 --> 00:21:42.116
clearly and completely to me.

00:21:42.555 --> 00:21:44.755
Now, do you still think
she outperformed you

00:21:44.755 --> 00:21:46.995
just because of her family resources?

00:21:52.396 --> 00:21:54.356
Consolidate
both your property preservation

00:21:54.596 --> 00:21:55.315
approaches.

00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:56.916
When possible, start preparing

00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:58.315
the preservation application early.

00:21:59.235 --> 00:21:59.735
Understood.

00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:06.504
(Property Preservation)

00:22:06.504 --> 00:22:08.874
(It refers to courts taking measures
before or after litigation)

00:22:08.874 --> 00:22:10.934
(to ensure enforcement of future
judgments or prevent property loss)

00:22:10.934 --> 00:22:12.194
(by restricting parties' control
over disputed assets)

00:22:12.194 --> 00:22:13.384
(via compulsory enforcement mechanisms.)

00:22:20.075 --> 00:22:20.596
Got scolded?

00:22:22.755 --> 00:22:23.275
Thanks.

00:22:25.075 --> 00:22:26.075
Don't you want to know

00:22:26.075 --> 00:22:27.156
where you fell short?

00:22:28.396 --> 00:22:29.396
Since childhood,

00:22:29.596 --> 00:22:31.755
I've watched countless
subordinates report

00:22:31.755 --> 00:22:33.836
in my father's and brother's offices.

00:22:34.356 --> 00:22:35.676
And I realized

00:22:35.755 --> 00:22:37.315
it's my unique edge

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:38.836
that others can't replicate.

00:22:41.035 --> 00:22:41.795
Congratulations.

00:22:42.515 --> 00:22:44.396
You failed
to report promptly to Ms. Bai.

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:46.396
Did you think the task was too simple?

00:22:46.676 --> 00:22:47.916
Or do you fear your superior?

00:22:49.676 --> 00:22:50.475
So,

00:22:51.676 --> 00:22:52.436
are you arrogant

00:22:53.636 --> 00:22:54.396
or insecure?

00:23:00.475 --> 00:23:01.075
Yan Fei,

00:23:02.035 --> 00:23:03.916
if you thought I'd crumble
from these words,

00:23:04.475 --> 00:23:05.596
you'd be underestimating me.

00:23:06.315 --> 00:23:07.836
If you did everything flawlessly,

00:23:08.116 --> 00:23:08.836
why did Ms. Bai

00:23:08.836 --> 00:23:10.396
assign the consolidation task to me?

00:23:12.795 --> 00:23:15.275
You kept saying you wanted
to join Mr. Song's team before.

00:23:15.515 --> 00:23:16.916
Now you're so invested in Ms. Bai's

00:23:16.916 --> 00:23:17.755
team's work.

00:23:18.436 --> 00:23:19.916
Have you changed your mind?

00:23:20.995 --> 00:23:22.636
Choosing a good friend is important.

00:23:23.075 --> 00:23:25.315
But choosing a worthy rival
is even more important.

00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:27.035
I think you're

00:23:28.275 --> 00:23:28.775
impressive.

00:23:29.555 --> 00:23:30.055
Thanks.

00:23:30.755 --> 00:23:31.715
I think you are too.

00:23:32.436 --> 00:23:34.475
But if only one can remain in the end,

00:23:35.035 --> 00:23:35.795
it has to be me.

00:23:42.515 --> 00:23:43.715
Mr. Song, I've printed

00:23:43.715 --> 00:23:44.956
He Hui's project documents

00:23:44.956 --> 00:23:45.755
you asked for.

00:23:46.116 --> 00:23:48.075
Will they partner with Tian Kai Xin?

00:23:48.475 --> 00:23:48.975
No.

00:23:50.876 --> 00:23:52.116
Are there plans?

00:23:53.035 --> 00:23:53.956
There won't ever be.

00:23:55.956 --> 00:23:56.995
Let me introduce you.

00:23:57.475 --> 00:23:58.636
This is Mr. Hu.

00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:00.436
He's handling He Hui's acquisition.

00:24:00.795 --> 00:24:01.836
He's vital to our team.

00:24:02.196 --> 00:24:04.436
He urgently needs two interns to assist.

00:24:04.795 --> 00:24:06.356
I recommended you and Xiaoyu.

00:24:06.836 --> 00:24:07.676
Xiaoyu has agreed.

00:24:08.436 --> 00:24:08.936
And you?

00:24:09.715 --> 00:24:10.275
Any issues?

00:24:11.035 --> 00:24:12.116
I don't have issues.

00:24:12.116 --> 00:24:13.356
But on my end...

00:24:13.555 --> 00:24:14.055
Don't worry.

00:24:14.555 --> 00:24:15.515
I'll talk to Ms. Bai.

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:18.356
I had Mr. Zhou tell you

00:24:18.515 --> 00:24:20.436
that you'd follow the Tian Kai Xin case.

00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:21.676
Otherwise,

00:24:21.795 --> 00:24:22.956
I couldn't have won you over.

00:24:23.715 --> 00:24:25.715
Dispute resolution
is fascinating indeed,

00:24:26.116 --> 00:24:28.156
but non-litigation work
also presents challenges.

00:24:28.636 --> 00:24:29.795
Your performance earlier

00:24:30.436 --> 00:24:31.156
was remarkable.

00:24:32.475 --> 00:24:33.356
Seize the chance

00:24:33.636 --> 00:24:34.436
for diversity.

00:24:34.916 --> 00:24:35.596
That way,

00:24:36.156 --> 00:24:37.035
you'll know

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:38.596
the expertise you want.

00:24:40.876 --> 00:24:41.475
Thank you.

00:24:42.116 --> 00:24:42.755
Mr. Song,

00:24:43.475 --> 00:24:44.795
I'm right here sitting with you.

00:24:44.956 --> 00:24:46.035
Don't play favorites.

00:24:46.475 --> 00:24:48.636
Rest assured.
I'll treat everyone equally.

00:24:49.075 --> 00:24:50.275
But you need to fight harder.

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:51.676
Don't always stay down.

00:24:52.235 --> 00:24:53.916
It'll make me look bad as your mentor.

00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:55.636
I believe

00:24:56.196 --> 00:24:57.956
my judgment about people won't fail.

00:24:59.555 --> 00:25:00.396
Shock everyone.

00:25:04.396 --> 00:25:05.596
I knew you were up to no good.

00:25:05.596 --> 00:25:06.676
Poaching my team now?

00:25:07.836 --> 00:25:08.795
I'll take that as a yes.

00:25:13.916 --> 00:25:15.235
These kids now

00:25:15.235 --> 00:25:16.676
are outworking each other fiercely.

00:25:18.275 --> 00:25:18.956
Ms. Bai,

00:25:19.515 --> 00:25:20.795
you praised Yan Fei

00:25:20.795 --> 00:25:21.916
in front of Ren Jiatong.

00:25:21.916 --> 00:25:22.596
I get that.

00:25:23.475 --> 00:25:24.795
But which move did you play

00:25:25.196 --> 00:25:26.876
to motivate Yan Fei so well?

00:25:28.116 --> 00:25:29.876
I met her brother earlier

00:25:30.196 --> 00:25:30.956
at a banquet.

00:25:31.636 --> 00:25:33.916
He unexpectedly supported her
staying at Jun An

00:25:34.235 --> 00:25:35.555
and even her joining your team.

00:25:37.196 --> 00:25:38.596
You knew her brother came to me?

00:25:39.156 --> 00:25:40.396
She's smarter than I expected

00:25:40.555 --> 00:25:41.676
but also more rebellious

00:25:41.676 --> 00:25:43.080
toward her brother than I thought.

00:25:44.995 --> 00:25:46.436
If we messed up back then,

00:25:46.715 --> 00:25:47.880
our mentors would scold us.

00:25:48.116 --> 00:25:49.475
Dealing with these kids now

00:25:49.515 --> 00:25:50.436
requires strategies.

00:25:50.995 --> 00:25:53.224
We act by The Art of War
and the Thirty-Six Stratagems.

00:25:54.836 --> 00:25:56.596
This profession isn't easy.

00:25:56.956 --> 00:25:57.456
True.

00:25:58.035 --> 00:25:58.715
It takes time.

00:25:59.075 --> 00:26:00.196
We've been there too.

00:26:02.235 --> 00:26:02.735
Right,

00:26:02.836 --> 00:26:03.715
Tian Min said

00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:05.315
she saw those two

00:26:05.315 --> 00:26:06.676
declaring war in the pantry.

00:26:07.035 --> 00:26:09.196
They said, "If only one could stay,"

00:26:09.596 --> 00:26:10.715
"it should be me."

00:26:11.475 --> 00:26:12.876
Doesn't that sound familiar?

00:26:13.156 --> 00:26:14.876
Exactly what we said back then.

00:26:20.396 --> 00:26:21.116
It's so late now.

00:26:21.396 --> 00:26:22.555
You should go home to Niuniu.

00:26:22.995 --> 00:26:23.876
Pack your things.

00:26:24.035 --> 00:26:24.676
I'll drive you.

00:26:29.795 --> 00:26:30.984
Where's the pen I gave you?

00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:32.555
Have you used it?

00:26:34.715 --> 00:26:35.356
It's expensive.

00:26:35.755 --> 00:26:36.596
I fear I'll ruin it.

00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:37.795
Then buy a new one.

00:26:40.676 --> 00:26:41.475
Did you throw it?

00:26:41.515 --> 00:26:42.676
I'm stingy with money.

00:26:42.836 --> 00:26:43.956
I'd never throw it away.

00:26:44.035 --> 00:26:45.475
I'll keep it as a collector's item.

00:26:46.755 --> 00:26:47.255
Let's go.

00:26:47.676 --> 00:26:48.315
Grab my bag.

00:26:53.596 --> 00:26:54.096
Let's go.

00:27:03.995 --> 00:27:04.495
Ms. Bai,

00:27:05.356 --> 00:27:06.156
about that pen,

00:27:06.755 --> 00:27:07.876
I thought it looked nice.

00:27:08.475 --> 00:27:09.156
So I got it

00:27:09.515 --> 00:27:10.075
for you.

00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:11.436
No hidden agenda.

00:27:15.035 --> 00:27:16.436
Stop playing dumb with me.

00:27:17.596 --> 00:27:19.795
Yes, I do have a similar one.

00:27:20.956 --> 00:27:22.396
But I truly meant nothing by it.

00:27:22.636 --> 00:27:23.676
You're missing the point.

00:27:24.755 --> 00:27:25.676
I was thinking

00:27:26.156 --> 00:27:27.555
about Jiang Chen.

00:27:27.755 --> 00:27:28.995
He's my disciple.

00:27:29.515 --> 00:27:30.315
You may borrow him.

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:31.515
But outright poaching?

00:27:31.676 --> 00:27:33.275
He ultimately belongs to our team.

00:27:33.315 --> 00:27:34.315
Don't change the topic.

00:27:34.555 --> 00:27:36.235
I'm talking about the pen.

00:27:37.275 --> 00:27:38.235
In the old days,

00:27:38.755 --> 00:27:40.315
you'd invite me to a concert

00:27:40.916 --> 00:27:42.515
or some pricey wine,

00:27:43.116 --> 00:27:45.116
then ceremoniously return the gift

00:27:45.116 --> 00:27:46.156
still wrapped up.

00:27:46.596 --> 00:27:47.196
Mr. Song,

00:27:47.755 --> 00:27:49.315
I have matured since then, alright?

00:27:49.356 --> 00:27:50.436
Matured?

00:27:51.315 --> 00:27:52.956
It's twisting the knife in my heart.

00:27:53.636 --> 00:27:55.515
Do I mean nothing to you now?

00:27:55.676 --> 00:27:57.475
Not even the courtesy
of a formal rejection?

00:27:58.515 --> 00:27:59.075
Well,

00:27:59.436 --> 00:28:01.515
fine wine costs.

00:28:01.916 --> 00:28:03.075
If you gift me a pen,

00:28:03.075 --> 00:28:04.315
I'll actually use it.

00:28:04.636 --> 00:28:05.436
But wine?

00:28:06.035 --> 00:28:07.035
Gone in one sitting.

00:28:07.035 --> 00:28:08.235
What a waste.

00:28:08.555 --> 00:28:09.676
Since when

00:28:09.676 --> 00:28:11.596
did you become so transactional with me?

00:28:11.596 --> 00:28:12.235
Is it necessary?

00:28:12.555 --> 00:28:13.596
I need precision.

00:28:13.596 --> 00:28:15.116
How else would I practice law?

00:28:15.715 --> 00:28:17.235
Don't worry, I'll save that wine money

00:28:17.916 --> 00:28:18.676
for a rainy day.

00:28:19.475 --> 00:28:20.956
When you finally ditch the grind

00:28:20.956 --> 00:28:22.235
and settle down to marry,

00:28:22.475 --> 00:28:23.836
I'll gift you a huge red packet.

00:28:23.995 --> 00:28:24.495
I mean it.

00:28:25.515 --> 00:28:26.555
I can't believe you.

00:28:26.636 --> 00:28:27.136
I'm leaving.

00:28:34.636 --> 00:28:35.136
Ms. Bai.

00:28:35.956 --> 00:28:36.475
Please.

00:28:37.156 --> 00:28:37.755
Just don't

00:28:38.156 --> 00:28:38.795
throw it away.

00:28:39.396 --> 00:28:39.896
Okay.

00:28:40.515 --> 00:28:41.916
I'll start using it tomorrow, okay?

00:28:45.836 --> 00:28:46.336
See you.

00:29:07.836 --> 00:29:09.116
Now I see why they

00:29:09.116 --> 00:29:10.475
assigned both of us to this.

00:29:11.235 --> 00:29:13.315
It seemed straightforward initially.

00:29:13.795 --> 00:29:15.315
Da Yuan holds 100% equity

00:29:15.315 --> 00:29:16.436
in Zhong Yuan.

00:29:16.795 --> 00:29:18.275
He Hui wants to acquire Zhong Yuan

00:29:18.275 --> 00:29:19.356
from Da Yuan,

00:29:19.636 --> 00:29:20.836
so they've hired our firm

00:29:20.836 --> 00:29:21.636
as legal counsel.

00:29:21.995 --> 00:29:23.035
But digging deeper,

00:29:23.475 --> 00:29:24.795
Zhong Yuan has

00:29:24.795 --> 00:29:26.315
so many subsidiaries.

00:29:26.596 --> 00:29:27.916
Due diligence for each one?

00:29:27.916 --> 00:29:30.116
My head is spinning.

00:29:30.596 --> 00:29:31.876
The other subsidiaries

00:29:31.876 --> 00:29:34.075
were mostly covered by Mr. Hu.

00:29:34.436 --> 00:29:37.235
Only Tian Yu subsidiary remains,

00:29:37.235 --> 00:29:38.315
but they declined by email.

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:39.196
Basically,

00:29:39.196 --> 00:29:40.755
Tian Yu is just a shell company

00:29:40.755 --> 00:29:42.035
with no active operations.

00:29:42.275 --> 00:29:43.315
So they couldn't provide

00:29:43.315 --> 00:29:44.676
the due diligence materials to us.

00:29:45.035 --> 00:29:46.315
This is suspicious.

00:29:47.275 --> 00:29:49.636
But if even the senior attorneys
can't handle this,

00:29:50.156 --> 00:29:52.035
what can a few interns like us do?

00:29:53.475 --> 00:29:54.596
Mr. Hu said he's applied

00:29:54.596 --> 00:29:55.876
to interview at Zhong Yuan.

00:29:55.956 --> 00:29:56.836
An on-site one.

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:57.876
He'll take us then.

00:29:57.876 --> 00:29:59.916
We'll see if we can uncover anything.

00:30:00.636 --> 00:30:01.136
Okay.

00:30:02.035 --> 00:30:02.715
Then I'll use

00:30:02.715 --> 00:30:04.916
my 24K-gold sharp eyes

00:30:05.035 --> 00:30:06.035
to scan them.

00:30:06.636 --> 00:30:08.035
If that fails, I'll deploy my

00:30:08.755 --> 00:30:10.836
sweet smile to charm them.

00:30:11.836 --> 00:30:13.035
Maybe I can get something.

00:30:15.075 --> 00:30:16.636
Want coffee?

00:30:17.075 --> 00:30:17.575
Yes.

00:30:17.995 --> 00:30:18.795
My mentor told me

00:30:18.795 --> 00:30:19.916
I must nail this case.

00:30:20.232 --> 00:30:22.515
If I don't turn things around
to make that old man proud,

00:30:22.515 --> 00:30:23.235
maybe he'll never

00:30:23.235 --> 00:30:24.715
live it down in front of Ms. Bai.

00:30:25.356 --> 00:30:26.396
If your mentor finds out

00:30:26.396 --> 00:30:28.156
you call him "old man" behind his back,

00:30:28.315 --> 00:30:29.436
he might never

00:30:29.436 --> 00:30:31.235
mention you to Ms. Bai ever again.

00:30:33.995 --> 00:30:34.495
Okay.

00:30:35.515 --> 00:30:36.075
Americano?

00:30:44.924 --> 00:30:46.994
(Within 3 working days
after the contract effective date,)

00:30:46.994 --> 00:30:48.616
(Party A shall pay Party B 50% thereof,
i.e., RMB 250,000.00.)

00:30:48.616 --> 00:30:51.756
(Revoke clause: Within 3 working days
after the contract effective date,)

00:30:51.756 --> 00:30:55.995
(Party A shall pay Party B 50% thereof,
i.e., RMB 250,000.00.)

00:31:00.328 --> 00:31:01.078
(Due Diligence)

00:31:01.078 --> 00:31:04.288
(Comprehensive background verification
for transaction subjects or partners)

00:31:04.288 --> 00:31:08.104
(on, e.g., assets, liabilities, compliance.
Common in non-litigation services.)

00:31:15.275 --> 00:31:16.156
Got two minutes?

00:31:16.156 --> 00:31:16.795
Need your help.

00:31:17.836 --> 00:31:18.396
What's up?

00:31:19.196 --> 00:31:19.995
You scared me.

00:31:20.995 --> 00:31:22.995
I made a litigation visualization chart.

00:31:22.995 --> 00:31:23.715
Can you review it?

00:31:25.156 --> 00:31:25.656
Five.

00:31:26.555 --> 00:31:27.055
Four.

00:31:27.555 --> 00:31:28.055
Three.

00:31:28.836 --> 00:31:29.336
Two.

00:31:30.275 --> 00:31:30.775
One.

00:31:30.916 --> 00:31:32.075
Got it in five seconds?

00:31:32.156 --> 00:31:34.156
Yes. The logic is solid.

00:31:34.315 --> 00:31:35.436
Key legal relationships

00:31:35.436 --> 00:31:36.436
are clearly presented.

00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:38.396
The chart simplifies complex points.

00:31:38.475 --> 00:31:39.075
Perfect.

00:31:40.196 --> 00:31:40.956
Ms. Bai's task?

00:31:43.116 --> 00:31:44.715
No, she criticized my work.

00:31:44.876 --> 00:31:46.315
Said I never consider

00:31:46.315 --> 00:31:47.596
senior attorneys during tasks.

00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:49.116
So from now on,

00:31:49.116 --> 00:31:50.715
I'll think one step ahead on every task.

00:31:50.956 --> 00:31:52.475
You don't understand this case,

00:31:52.475 --> 00:31:53.676
but you grasped it in seconds.

00:31:53.676 --> 00:31:55.475
Meaning any judge would understand too.

00:31:56.995 --> 00:31:58.515
You're becoming Ms. Bai's mini-me.

00:31:59.275 --> 00:32:00.795
Friendly advice though,

00:32:01.075 --> 00:32:02.515
don't worship idols blindly.

00:32:03.436 --> 00:32:05.035
My dad told me

00:32:05.116 --> 00:32:06.555
idols are meant to be humanized.

00:32:06.715 --> 00:32:07.215
Humans

00:32:07.795 --> 00:32:08.515
have flaws.

00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:10.876
Never stop thinking independently.

00:32:12.515 --> 00:32:13.356
Thanks, Mr. Jiang.

00:32:13.916 --> 00:32:15.275
But I need her to notice me first.

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:17.956
Let's grab dinner.

00:32:18.475 --> 00:32:19.475
I've got a briefing soon.

00:32:20.475 --> 00:32:21.356
Don't say no yet.

00:32:22.555 --> 00:32:23.956
Seriously, thank you.

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:26.356
You got my dad and me to share a meal.

00:32:27.396 --> 00:32:28.596
It healed something in me.

00:32:29.356 --> 00:32:30.876
Let me return the favor.

00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:31.616
Deal?

00:32:37.836 --> 00:32:38.596
Hello.

00:32:39.075 --> 00:32:41.475
Someone promised coffee. Where is it?

00:32:43.676 --> 00:32:45.836
And I definitely heard a dinner offer.

00:32:46.196 --> 00:32:47.235
How'd you hear that?

00:32:48.555 --> 00:32:49.396
So it's real?

00:32:50.636 --> 00:32:52.196
Yes, a group dinner with everyone.

00:32:52.196 --> 00:32:53.636
Get Li Ke and Yan Fei too.

00:32:53.836 --> 00:32:55.715
Okay, get Yue too.

00:32:55.715 --> 00:32:57.235
She's wedding dress shopping nearby.

00:32:57.995 --> 00:32:59.876
Want to invite Mr. Zhuang?

00:32:59.876 --> 00:33:00.636
Walk to his office,

00:33:00.636 --> 00:33:01.555
knock on his door,

00:33:01.555 --> 00:33:02.235
and tell him.

00:33:05.636 --> 00:33:06.136
Well?

00:33:06.755 --> 00:33:07.596
Go ahead without me.

00:33:07.596 --> 00:33:08.715
I'll catch up later.

00:33:08.995 --> 00:33:09.495
Okay.

00:33:09.795 --> 00:33:10.295
Do come.

00:33:11.596 --> 00:33:13.235
Finally got my coffee. Thanks.

00:33:13.356 --> 00:33:14.676
How did you actually hear us?

00:33:14.956 --> 00:33:16.075
Let me try your seat.

00:33:18.715 --> 00:33:19.215
Thanks.

00:33:19.636 --> 00:33:20.836
Didn't expect you to come.

00:33:22.235 --> 00:33:24.396
I've been pulling nonstop shifts
at the firm.

00:33:24.396 --> 00:33:25.475
I needed a ride.

00:33:26.116 --> 00:33:27.836
My overtime feels like

00:33:27.876 --> 00:33:29.315
another lifetime ago.

00:33:29.636 --> 00:33:31.396
I lost hair daily
from anxiety back then.

00:33:32.196 --> 00:33:33.836
Now that I've heard you say it,

00:33:34.035 --> 00:33:35.715
I actually feel nostalgic
for those days.

00:33:36.515 --> 00:33:37.876
When's the wedding date?

00:33:39.275 --> 00:33:40.356
We're still picking a date.

00:33:40.836 --> 00:33:41.795
If things go well,

00:33:42.116 --> 00:33:42.795
it's next month.

00:33:43.676 --> 00:33:44.715
Congratulations.

00:33:48.555 --> 00:33:50.356
What's that look for?

00:33:53.475 --> 00:33:54.515
How do I put this?

00:33:55.555 --> 00:33:56.356
In theory,

00:33:56.596 --> 00:33:58.555
I've finally achieved
everything I wanted.

00:33:59.755 --> 00:34:02.356
But I feel an emptiness inside.

00:34:03.836 --> 00:34:04.876
It just seems

00:34:05.116 --> 00:34:06.555
all this was what I once

00:34:06.555 --> 00:34:07.795
exhausted myself pursuing.

00:34:08.475 --> 00:34:11.155
Like being perfectly cared for by a man,

00:34:11.555 --> 00:34:13.155
following his schedule every day,

00:34:13.155 --> 00:34:14.396
and learning how to be a wife.

00:34:14.796 --> 00:34:16.916
But being fully supported like that,

00:34:16.995 --> 00:34:17.876
over time,

00:34:18.115 --> 00:34:19.956
it felt like my feet
weren't on the ground.

00:34:20.396 --> 00:34:21.756
Then one day I started panicking.

00:34:23.115 --> 00:34:24.396
The loss of control?

00:34:25.075 --> 00:34:25.575
Exactly.

00:34:25.756 --> 00:34:26.675
That's the feeling.

00:34:28.836 --> 00:34:29.675
I got scared.

00:34:30.475 --> 00:34:32.436
I'm afraid marriage
will erode our love over time

00:34:32.756 --> 00:34:34.716
and wear away my ambition
and professional skills.

00:34:35.035 --> 00:34:36.796
Until I completely lose myself.

00:34:37.276 --> 00:34:39.035
Then wherever he goes,
I'd have to follow.

00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:42.155
He's even planned out
my pregnancy timeline.

00:34:42.956 --> 00:34:44.236
I'm only in my twenties.

00:34:44.675 --> 00:34:45.716
My whole future life

00:34:45.956 --> 00:34:47.356
would revolve around him and kids.

00:34:47.716 --> 00:34:48.555
I'd have no career,

00:34:48.716 --> 00:34:50.035
no social life, and no friends.

00:34:50.195 --> 00:34:50.956
If anything

00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:52.515
ever happens to us,

00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:54.475
I could lose everything.

00:34:59.916 --> 00:35:01.316
Am I being overly dramatic?

00:35:02.436 --> 00:35:03.195
Not at all.

00:35:04.236 --> 00:35:06.195
When going through
such drastic life changes,

00:35:06.195 --> 00:35:08.155
emotional ups and downs
are completely normal.

00:35:08.475 --> 00:35:09.956
Besides, nobody says

00:35:09.956 --> 00:35:11.396
a housewife's life

00:35:11.396 --> 00:35:12.956
can't include friends or social events.

00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:15.796
Good point.

00:35:16.396 --> 00:35:17.635
Looking back now,

00:35:18.236 --> 00:35:19.916
the reason I chose him back then

00:35:20.595 --> 00:35:22.756
was because I'd chased
this lifestyle for too long.

00:35:23.075 --> 00:35:24.356
When he handed it to me,

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:25.396
I couldn't say no.

00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:27.916
Also,

00:35:28.356 --> 00:35:29.956
maybe beyond socializing and friends,

00:35:31.515 --> 00:35:32.555
I need colleagues too.

00:35:35.595 --> 00:35:37.635
Being a wealthy wife
isn't exactly stress-free.

00:35:38.075 --> 00:35:40.635
But you should protect yourself legally
before marriage.

00:35:40.716 --> 00:35:41.916
Think about that.

00:35:42.716 --> 00:35:44.236
Don't just focus on negative examples.

00:35:44.396 --> 00:35:45.436
Plenty of wives thrive.

00:35:45.916 --> 00:35:47.236
Let's take my mom for instance.

00:35:47.276 --> 00:35:48.675
Spoiled by my dad her whole life.

00:35:48.756 --> 00:35:50.396
Now doted on by my brother.

00:35:50.436 --> 00:35:51.916
She never worked a day.

00:35:52.155 --> 00:35:53.475
Even in her sixties now,

00:35:53.595 --> 00:35:55.436
she's still youthful as ever.

00:35:56.236 --> 00:35:57.956
So when you're that fortunate,

00:35:58.115 --> 00:35:58.916
it's quite good.

00:35:59.396 --> 00:36:01.035
In the long run,

00:36:01.236 --> 00:36:03.515
marriages survive
on mutual respect and conscience.

00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:05.595
Your current panic

00:36:05.635 --> 00:36:06.956
is mostly in your head.

00:36:09.796 --> 00:36:11.035
You haven't changed at all.

00:36:12.595 --> 00:36:13.876
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:36:20.827 --> 00:36:22.876
(Noodles)

00:36:22.876 --> 00:36:23.376
Ma'am,

00:36:23.675 --> 00:36:25.075
any more trouble here lately?

00:36:26.035 --> 00:36:27.195
All quiet now.

00:36:28.075 --> 00:36:28.575
Okay.

00:36:34.075 --> 00:36:34.876
Slow down.

00:36:34.876 --> 00:36:35.876
It's rare to relax.

00:36:36.035 --> 00:36:36.756
Got work to do.

00:36:36.756 --> 00:36:37.396
I need to go.

00:36:37.675 --> 00:36:38.276
Going back?

00:36:50.756 --> 00:36:51.436
I can't wait.

00:36:51.956 --> 00:36:52.595
Maybe next time.

00:36:53.115 --> 00:36:53.615
Leaving now?

00:36:53.995 --> 00:36:54.495
Bye.

00:36:59.595 --> 00:37:01.316
The property management called.

00:37:01.316 --> 00:37:02.836
I'll go and handle them.

00:37:03.995 --> 00:37:04.635
Stop eating.

00:37:07.155 --> 00:37:08.316
Read the contract carefully.

00:37:08.515 --> 00:37:09.316
It's clear.

00:37:09.675 --> 00:37:11.916
Either party
may terminate the lease early.

00:37:12.115 --> 00:37:13.236
But if the lessee

00:37:13.236 --> 00:37:14.595
causes property damage,

00:37:14.876 --> 00:37:17.276
the lessor won't refund prepaid rent.

00:37:17.675 --> 00:37:20.276
(Xiaoyu's Legal Tips)
Lessor may charge lessee for repairs.

00:37:22.115 --> 00:37:24.075
Your AC unit and sign installation

00:37:24.316 --> 00:37:25.796
damaged the shop's walls.

00:37:26.195 --> 00:37:28.195
Therefore, we cannot refund your rent.

00:37:28.356 --> 00:37:30.475
Also, you need to pay
an additional half month's rent

00:37:30.836 --> 00:37:31.716
as the repair fee.

00:37:32.276 --> 00:37:32.776
Thank you.

00:37:32.796 --> 00:37:33.296
Followers,

00:37:33.675 --> 00:37:35.276
the management is twisting the facts.

00:37:35.475 --> 00:37:38.276
They're falsely labeling renovations
as damage.

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:39.035
Legally,

00:37:39.236 --> 00:37:41.075
when the lessee, who is the shop owner,

00:37:41.475 --> 00:37:43.635
adds attachments to the property,

00:37:43.716 --> 00:37:45.115
they must get the lessor's consent.

00:37:45.316 --> 00:37:46.555
Upon contract termination,

00:37:46.635 --> 00:37:48.316
both parties can negotiate
to remove them.

00:37:48.635 --> 00:37:50.115
Now the air conditioner and signboard

00:37:50.115 --> 00:37:51.075
qualify as attachments.

00:37:51.396 --> 00:37:53.356
Shop renovations now

00:37:53.436 --> 00:37:54.236
need management's

00:37:54.236 --> 00:37:56.276
approval before being started.

00:37:56.475 --> 00:37:56.975
Exactly.

00:37:56.995 --> 00:37:58.956
The termination
was initiated by you, the lessor.

00:37:59.115 --> 00:37:59.916
Per the Supreme Court's

00:37:59.995 --> 00:38:01.796
judicial interpretations
of lease contracts,

00:38:02.115 --> 00:38:03.956
you must not only
refund the remaining rent

00:38:03.995 --> 00:38:05.756
but also compensate
for the residual value

00:38:05.876 --> 00:38:06.555
of renovations.

00:38:08.115 --> 00:38:09.595
I also have an addendum

00:38:09.916 --> 00:38:11.155
on future pipe replacements

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.035
for the shop.

00:38:12.035 --> 00:38:12.675
Please read it.

00:38:12.956 --> 00:38:13.675
An addendum too?

00:38:15.115 --> 00:38:16.115
Why did you come back?

00:38:16.436 --> 00:38:17.916
Where did you find this addendum?

00:38:18.075 --> 00:38:19.756
Wang Lu just called
to remind me about it.

00:38:33.115 --> 00:38:33.716
Hello, Wang Lu?

00:38:33.716 --> 00:38:34.216
Li Ke.

00:38:34.675 --> 00:38:35.796
I'm watching the live stream.

00:38:36.276 --> 00:38:37.276
Locate the addendum.

00:38:37.675 --> 00:38:39.356
Check the handwritten clause

00:38:39.356 --> 00:38:40.515
in the "other terms" section.

00:38:40.555 --> 00:38:42.075
I helped draft it

00:38:42.075 --> 00:38:43.796
through a student legal aid activity

00:38:43.796 --> 00:38:44.555
back in college.

00:38:44.836 --> 00:38:46.916
It states neither party may terminate

00:38:46.916 --> 00:38:48.316
before the lease expiration date.

00:38:48.675 --> 00:38:50.796
Violation requires
paying one month's rent

00:38:50.796 --> 00:38:51.555
as damages.

00:38:51.916 --> 00:38:53.155
When the original lease

00:38:53.316 --> 00:38:54.756
and the addendum conflict,

00:38:54.836 --> 00:38:56.075
the addendum stipulates.

00:38:56.195 --> 00:38:57.595
So if you proceed with termination,

00:38:58.276 --> 00:38:59.436
you'll have to pay

00:39:00.195 --> 00:39:02.075
both the compensation
and an extra month's rent.

00:39:03.555 --> 00:39:04.436
Well, sir?

00:39:05.035 --> 00:39:06.916
I'll report this to my superior.

00:39:07.155 --> 00:39:07.655
Hold on.

00:39:08.635 --> 00:39:09.276
Wang Lu,

00:39:10.716 --> 00:39:12.276
are you actually watching us live?

00:39:12.675 --> 00:39:13.716
Wang Lu, how are you?

00:39:13.716 --> 00:39:14.995
Thank you.

00:39:16.635 --> 00:39:18.356
You guys are amazing.

00:39:19.236 --> 00:39:20.595
Thank you all.

00:39:20.595 --> 00:39:21.836
Ma'am, you can't move away.

00:39:21.916 --> 00:39:23.035
We all love your noodles.

00:39:23.316 --> 00:39:24.232
Noodles on the house.

00:39:25.876 --> 00:39:27.796
Cheers!

00:39:31.876 --> 00:39:34.115
Though we're just interns,

00:39:34.675 --> 00:39:36.836
this victory feels incredible.

00:39:37.356 --> 00:39:38.716
Too bad we missed the main action.

00:39:39.115 --> 00:39:40.876
But catching the property manager

00:39:40.876 --> 00:39:42.635
personally delivering wine to apologize

00:39:42.796 --> 00:39:43.675
made it worthwhile.

00:39:45.436 --> 00:39:45.936
Li Ke,

00:39:46.115 --> 00:39:47.716
thanks for shielding me earlier.

00:39:47.796 --> 00:39:48.436
Are you okay?

00:39:49.035 --> 00:39:49.535
I'm fine.

00:39:50.155 --> 00:39:51.796
You were about to leave earlier,

00:39:51.796 --> 00:39:52.956
yet you came back halfway

00:39:52.956 --> 00:39:54.195
and spent time helping us.

00:39:54.515 --> 00:39:55.035
Seriously.

00:39:57.035 --> 00:39:59.316
My mind was completely focused on work.

00:39:59.475 --> 00:40:00.555
But seeing them bullied

00:40:00.555 --> 00:40:01.836
really got me furious.

00:40:02.836 --> 00:40:03.336
Enough.

00:40:03.716 --> 00:40:05.035
No more work talk today.

00:40:05.635 --> 00:40:06.135
Cheers!

00:40:06.276 --> 00:40:06.776
Cheers!

00:40:06.956 --> 00:40:07.515
Cheers!

00:40:14.155 --> 00:40:15.956
Li Ke, how have you been lately?

00:40:16.515 --> 00:40:17.916
Those dark circles under your eyes

00:40:17.916 --> 00:40:19.515
are almost as big as my idol Hua Hua's.

00:40:19.836 --> 00:40:20.555
What Hua Hua?

00:40:20.916 --> 00:40:21.595
The panda.

00:40:22.716 --> 00:40:23.716
Result of all-nighters.

00:40:24.396 --> 00:40:25.115
Honestly though,

00:40:25.115 --> 00:40:26.595
I'm actually envious of you all now.

00:40:26.956 --> 00:40:28.035
The more I consider it,

00:40:28.316 --> 00:40:29.576
the more I feel work suits me.

00:40:32.675 --> 00:40:33.796
Giving up on your older guy?

00:40:33.956 --> 00:40:34.728
Can you bear it?

00:40:35.035 --> 00:40:35.836
Absolutely.

00:40:35.899 --> 00:40:37.608
(Talk later. Busy now.)

00:40:40.195 --> 00:40:42.155
What do you mean by "absolutely"?

00:40:43.796 --> 00:40:44.876
Stop pretending.

00:40:45.436 --> 00:40:46.515
No matter how good

00:40:46.515 --> 00:40:47.555
a lawyer is,

00:40:47.555 --> 00:40:49.236
they're just a glorified worker, right?

00:40:49.555 --> 00:40:51.876
Your fiancé has great prospects
and truly loves you.

00:40:52.075 --> 00:40:53.035
You're in deep love.

00:40:53.436 --> 00:40:55.155
You're getting married.
So why stir the pot?

00:40:55.595 --> 00:40:57.236
We are forced into this.

00:40:57.436 --> 00:40:59.555
And you're just meddling needlessly.

00:41:00.916 --> 00:41:02.356
How are you "forced into this"?

00:41:02.356 --> 00:41:04.075
Why call me "meddling"?

00:41:04.555 --> 00:41:05.716
How isn't this meddling?

00:41:06.396 --> 00:41:07.236
Among all present,

00:41:07.756 --> 00:41:09.115
some genuinely need this job.

00:41:09.836 --> 00:41:10.356
Ren Jiatong.

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:11.535
Me.

00:41:12.475 --> 00:41:12.975
Xiaoyu.

00:41:13.396 --> 00:41:14.396
But Fei,

00:41:14.876 --> 00:41:15.436
you,

00:41:16.155 --> 00:41:16.796
and you.

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:19.115
Do you three even actually need it?

00:41:19.716 --> 00:41:20.756
No matter how appealing

00:41:20.756 --> 00:41:21.956
the Jun An offer is,

00:41:22.236 --> 00:41:23.555
only the three of us

00:41:23.796 --> 00:41:25.075
might actually need it

00:41:25.356 --> 00:41:27.956
for survival and building careers.

00:41:28.515 --> 00:41:29.675
But you three

00:41:29.675 --> 00:41:31.716
might give up or quit any day

00:41:31.716 --> 00:41:32.836
and walk away abruptly.

00:41:32.916 --> 00:41:34.316
Why are you competing with us then?

00:41:34.316 --> 00:41:34.836
For what?

00:41:36.075 --> 00:41:37.436
Let's not put it that way.

00:41:38.716 --> 00:41:40.836
Having a wealthy dad, husband,
or brother

00:41:40.836 --> 00:41:41.796
isn't some original sin.

00:41:42.356 --> 00:41:44.276
Everyone selected deserves to be here.

00:41:44.595 --> 00:41:46.396
Making it to the end on your own merit

00:41:46.635 --> 00:41:47.356
is incredible.

00:41:47.635 --> 00:41:48.936
Leaving halfway isn't a shame.

00:41:49.064 --> 00:41:50.316
Numerous legal statutes exist.

00:41:50.316 --> 00:41:52.035
Why limit life to just choosing

00:41:52.075 --> 00:41:53.396
to do or not to do?

00:41:54.155 --> 00:41:55.356
Do you truly believe

00:41:55.756 --> 00:41:56.956
everyone selected deserves

00:41:57.236 --> 00:41:57.796
to be here?

00:41:58.075 --> 00:41:58.635
Of course.

00:42:05.595 --> 00:42:06.836
I just helped someone.

00:42:06.836 --> 00:42:07.995
I'm so thrilled.

00:42:08.555 --> 00:42:11.195
Jun An chose me. That shows I'm amazing.

00:42:11.675 --> 00:42:12.716
I'm not lacking at all.

00:42:13.236 --> 00:42:14.195
Staying in Beijing,

00:42:14.635 --> 00:42:15.515
I have no regrets.

00:42:16.515 --> 00:42:17.015
Bravo!

00:42:28.316 --> 00:42:29.595
What's this?

00:42:30.075 --> 00:42:32.836
Ren Jiatong said Zhu Zhisheng
is in that group chat.

00:42:32.836 --> 00:42:34.236
Yan Fei said, "I love you."

00:42:34.276 --> 00:42:35.595
Ren Jiatong replied, "Me too."

00:42:36.115 --> 00:42:36.876
Really?

00:42:37.356 --> 00:42:37.956
You made it up?

00:42:37.956 --> 00:42:40.876
It's true.
We girls have our own code language.

00:42:40.876 --> 00:42:42.356
Guys wouldn't get it.

00:42:45.716 --> 00:42:46.276
Cheers!

00:42:48.236 --> 00:42:49.316
Girls help girls.

00:42:50.356 --> 00:42:51.995
Xiaoyu, is this another thing

00:42:52.515 --> 00:42:54.515
guys might struggle to understand?

00:42:54.836 --> 00:42:55.336
Go ahead.

00:42:56.396 --> 00:42:57.475
I'm not lacking at all.

00:42:57.796 --> 00:42:58.796
Staying in Beijing,

00:42:58.995 --> 00:42:59.876
I have no regrets.

00:43:00.155 --> 00:43:01.396
I got your voice message too.

00:43:01.396 --> 00:43:02.436
You posted it

00:43:02.836 --> 00:43:04.035
in the main group chat.

00:43:04.155 --> 00:43:05.276
Zhu Zhisheng isn't in it.

00:43:05.276 --> 00:43:06.515
Only a few senior lawyers are.

00:43:12.195 --> 00:43:12.876
Stop laughing.

00:43:15.323 --> 00:43:16.584
(How can small businesses avoid
pitfalls when signing a shop lease?)

00:43:16.584 --> 00:43:18.873
(Answer: Verify the lessor's identity
and property ownership.)

00:43:18.873 --> 00:43:21.463
(Verify lessor's property certificates
and check for mortgage or seizure.)

00:43:21.463 --> 00:43:24.463
(Specify terms on lease, renewal,
deposit, upkeep, and subletting.)

00:43:24.463 --> 00:43:26.459
(Specify termination terms, penalties,
and compensation scope.)
