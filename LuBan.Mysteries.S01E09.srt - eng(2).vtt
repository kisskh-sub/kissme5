00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:46.520
There are fingermark bruises on the victim's neck

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.840
Deep subcutaneous hemorrhaging is present

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.920
This matches two-handed strangulation

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:52.719
Resulting in death by asphyxiation

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.079
It covers it up

00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:59.079
Little ghost

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:00.600
It must be a little ghost

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.039
The little ghost has come to claim a life

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.439
Aunt Xie, do not be afraid

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.480
Do not be afraid

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.239
They wanted to strangle the carpenter to death

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:08.400
At least

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:10.680
it had to be an adult about one meter seventy tall

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:13.000
The killer's method

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.480
is extremely cruel

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:16.120
Even scarier than a little ghost

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.599
We should find a safe place

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.480
and observe the situation first

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.319
The killer only wants to use this tactic

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.400
to trick us into leaving

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.000
If we really leave

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.599
we will be doing exactly what he wants

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.400
Right

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.159
Putting on spooky tricks, hiding everything

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.480
I want to see

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.359
who he is

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.719
The killer is in the dark, we are exposed

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.000
If we push him too far

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.719
our lives will be in danger too

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:38.760
What I mean is

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.200
we should find a safe place

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.719
and watch how things develop

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.439
It is not that I am afraid to die

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.799
No one said you are afraid to die

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.239
But if we leave

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.319
we will miss the best time to solve the case

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.480
If you want to leave, you leave

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.560
I am a police officer

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.799
I have to catch him no matter what

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.000
I also cannot be

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.439
a coward who clings to life and fears death

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.159
What do you two mean by that

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.519
Let me stress this again

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.959
I just want to find

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.519
some temporary safety

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:02.760
Fine

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.040
If you are not leaving

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:05.959
I will go find a safe spot first

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.360
Has the killer not already shown up uninvited

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.759
Brother, what do you mean by that

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.960
Just now all of us were over there chasing the killer

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.120
When we came back, the carpenter was dead

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:22.719
In this old house it was only you and Aunt Xie

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.439
So are you not the killer

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.360
Do not slander me out of greed for the estate

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.759
just so you can have it all to yourself

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.599
If I were the killer

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:31.719
would I murder my own mother

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.680
Uncle Xie was crushed by that beam pillar

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:35.840
I am physically weak

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.479
I cannot lift heavy things

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.360
You say you cannot, so we must believe you

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.479
Who would believe that

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.159
When Madam died

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:45.919
she was covered

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.080
from head to toe in children’s footprints

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.840
So that is how it is

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.400
Soul-Slaying Technique

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.080
Madam Zhang, Xie Xin

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.120
and his death

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.680
and the Little ghost traces everywhere

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.000
are just like what my master told me

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.479
about the Soul-Slaying Technique in Lu Ban's Secret Art

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.719
exactly the same

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.879
But the dark arts in Lu Ban's Secret Art

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.159
are nothing but heretical nonsense, right

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.000
If someone is using this secret art

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.800
to achieve some unspeakable goal

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.759
that is serious trouble

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.759
I am the heir to Lu Ban's Secret Art

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.400
If anyone wants to use this secret art

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.319
to harm others

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.240
I will never just stand by and ignore it

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.560
Fine

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.199
Since the killer's method is already clear

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:39.599
I think we should do this instead

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.840
All of us should gather in Master Zhang's room

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.280
First, we can keep an eye on each other

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.080
Second

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.120
we can also protect ourselves

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.479
Hold on, hold on, hold on

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.199
Why should whatever you say

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:51.000
decide what I have to do

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.080
If you ask me, you three are the most suspicious

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.840
There is a carpenter who knows Lu Ban's Secret Art

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.280
over one meter seventy tall

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:58.680
so are you not the killer

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:59.680
Show some respect

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.360
What nonsense are you talking

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.599
We are doing this to protect you

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.159
I never asked you bastards to protect me

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.560
We were all over there just now

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.199
and what happened to him was here

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.919
Do I have the power to be in two places at once

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.360
Everyone

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.599
I think big brother has a bit of a point

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.199
Ever since you came to the Zhang residence

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.680
there has been nothing but turmoil

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.160
and people dying again and again

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.600
Rather than stay together with you

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.560
I would rather stay in my own room

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.199
with the doors and windows shut

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:26.279
Tomorrow morning

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:28.160
I will go to the police station to file a report

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.959
If you want to report it, just go to him

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.959
Let us go

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.680
We will go to Master Zhang's room

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.879
Auntie Xie

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.040
What illness does Master Zhang have

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.240
The doctor said

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.079
it is from excessive fright

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.600
which caused a mental disorder

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.199
he can only recover slowly with rest

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:53.480
But

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.680
before this, the master

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.319
invited a fortune teller who said

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.240
the feng shui of this old house has collapsed

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.480
and the yang energy is leaking out

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.040
so Little ghosts have come to claim lives

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:03.959
Auntie Xie

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.680
all of that is complete nonsense

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.360
It seems to be the eldest young master's bedroom

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:45.000
Again they are using Little ghosts as a cover

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:46.800
He died from a pierced heart

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.560
Little ghost

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.040
Some of the blood spatter

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.240
does not match the location of the wound

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.920
It seems that after the killer and the victim struggled

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.680
the killer drew those footprints

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:05.680
There is a string of numbers in blood on his left palm

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.879
three one four

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:09.360
three one four

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:11.120
What does it mean

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.439
It is the date the will is to be announced tomorrow

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.040
This time when big brother came back

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:17.600
he kept harping on about splitting the inheritance

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:19.680
Tomorrow happens to be March fourteenth

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.639
the date my father asked the lawyer to announce the will

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.600
The killer left these numbers

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.319
and that is the same day Master Zhang announces the will

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.839
What is the connection

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:32.439
I am not sure either

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.199
All of this was arranged by my father

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.480
If I remember correctly

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.879
this is also the Zhang residence's

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.839
pile-driving and foundation-laying date

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:42.720
Pile-driving and foundation laying

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.800
The door to the room was tightly locked

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:48.279
How did the killer get into the room to kill him

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.399
Secret room

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.160
There is a secret room entrance here

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.160
Nice one, Old Li

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.720
That makes sense now

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.040
How did the killer enter and leave the room

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:28.920
and create the illusion of a little ghost killing

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:32.199
The killer must be highly skilled in carpentry

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.600
He used the beams and pillars

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.600
the wind tunnel and this secret room

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.759
to plan a premeditated murder

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.759
So it is clear tonight's murder

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.199
was definitely not done on a whim

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.480
It must have been planned for a long time

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:43.480
Go in and take a look

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.879
Be careful

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:05.160
Stop! Who is there

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.480
Stop

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.199
Stop

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:15.879
This way

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.720
Everyone, be careful

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:19.040
When I was checking just now

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.480
I found that Zhang Mengs gun was missing

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.839
Split up and chase

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:23.920
Okay

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:50.399
Old Li, look at this

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:53.320
Isnt this my mothers gramophone

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:05.919
Found it.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.759
This is the tool for faking ghosts and gods.

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:10.759
The singing travels through

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:12.639
that opening over there,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.879
into the wind tunnel outside,

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:15.679
then through the wind tunnel again

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.759
and spreads out.

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:18.759
That is how the creepy sound appears.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.600
Did you catch him?

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:28.159
I know who the killer is.

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:33.320
Did you find him?

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.919
All right, I got it.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:40.200
What did your friend say?

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:42.960
Using the address Auntie Xie gave,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.240
he went to that carpenter's house.

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:45.960
He really did not go home.

00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:48.720
That matches up.

00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:51.159
That matches up.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.480
This carpenter

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:55.759
used his sick child as an excuse to go home,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.159
creating for us

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.120
the illusion that he left the Zhang house.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.440
In fact, he left and came back.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.159
Then he found a way to hide in the secret room.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.279
He knew the structure of the beams and pillars well,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.440
so he used them to crush Xie Xin to death.

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:12.000
Then while the shaman carpenter was distracted,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.039
he crushed the carpenter to death.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.200
When the eldest young master returned to his room,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.279
he caught him off guard and killed him in one move.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.360
Each time he killed, he played

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.919
a creepy nursery rhyme,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.919
and left the little ghost's mark.

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:25.039
He framed his carefully planned murders

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.679
on the little ghost.

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:27.240
And then

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.840
he got himself off the hook.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.720
That actually sounds somewhat reasonable.

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:33.240
Then for that carpenter to kill so many people,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.720
what was his motive?

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:35.759
To kill for money, of course.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.039
Besides money,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.559
there probably is nothing else.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.039
That makes sense too.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.919
My dad's business is huge.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.840
Who knows how many livelihoods he took away.

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:48.440
He offended so many thugs and hoodlums.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.360
They used the carpenter's identity as a cover

00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:52.159
to sneak into the Zhangs' and seek revenge.

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:54.039
That is also understandable.

00:10:58.799 --> 00:10:59.399
Dad.

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:00.360
It is all right now, Dad.

00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:01.759
That faker who played at gods and ghosts,

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:03.559
the killer who caused my mom's death, has been found.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.080
We will report it to the police tomorrow.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.799
We will have that carpenter arrested.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.279
We will avenge my mom.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.279
Medicine.

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:10.240
Medicine.

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:11.399
Medicine, medicine.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.360
Medicine.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.679
Dad, drink your medicine.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:17.879
I am fine.

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:19.080
Dad.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:19.559
Thanks.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.720
I will ask Auntie Xie to cook you another bowl.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:22.960
Thanks.

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:23.639
All right.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.240
I will have Auntie Xie do it.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.679
You rest well first.

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:27.399
Thanks.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.240
The killer's goal was to kill Master Zhang.

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:34.679
Then why did he kill Xie Xin?

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:37.519
And why did the eldest young master leave that date?

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:39.840
None of this adds up.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.279
We have all been busy all night.

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:50.840
You must all be hungry.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.159
I made some flatbreads.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.519
Everyone, have some to fill your stomachs.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:56.159
Auntie Xie, you are so thoughtful.

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:57.360
I have not eaten all night.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.279
I am about to faint from hunger.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.480
Then eat some more.

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:00.679
Thank you, Auntie Xie.

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:01.600
Thanks.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.360
Dad.

00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:06.600
What is wrong with you?

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:08.639
Second young master,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.759
the master might be hungry too.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.919
I will feed him some flatbread.

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:14.200
You go and eat with everyone else.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.120
Smells so good.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.039
It really does.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.240
Eat.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.080
Fresh out of the pan is the best.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.440
Zhang Meng is dead.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.480
Zhang Sheng will die too.

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:43.080
Do not rush.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.600
You are next.
