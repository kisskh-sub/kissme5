00:01:50.282 --> 00:01:50.922
Quecha!

00:01:56.122 --> 00:01:58.282
Quecha, get up. Hurry.

00:01:58.842 --> 00:01:59.482
Hurry.

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:46.881
Shan Qiang!

00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:57.481
Two adult Earth Fiends.

00:02:57.562 --> 00:02:59.002
We're no match for them.

00:02:59.242 --> 00:03:00.282
Find a way out now.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.402
I'll hold them off.

00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:09.682
This way!

00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:10.522
Luo, Yu Rong,

00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:11.921
evacuate the wounded first.

00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:13.122
Let's go.

00:03:13.122 --> 00:03:13.921
Hurry!

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:18.721
Quick, get inside.

00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:21.842
Hurry.

00:03:22.242 --> 00:03:23.082
You go ahead.

00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:24.441
I'll cover you.

00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:25.962
Go.

00:03:25.962 --> 00:03:26.601
Be careful.

00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:44.082
- Third!
- Third!

00:03:44.082 --> 00:03:46.362
- Third!
- Third!

00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.841
Once entering the Twilight Chasm,

00:04:38.722 --> 00:04:40.162
fiends become human demons,

00:04:40.682 --> 00:04:42.122
and humans become fiendish wraiths.

00:05:10.482 --> 00:05:11.441
It's a dead end.

00:05:11.482 --> 00:05:12.521
This is the only exit.

00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:17.441
To deal with us,

00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:20.401
you even summoned
the ancestral Earth Demons.

00:05:22.881 --> 00:05:23.602
Fine then.

00:05:24.602 --> 00:05:27.002
Let's settle all scores at once.

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:29.441
What's she saying?

00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:33.840
The underworld is where fiends dwell.

00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:39.602
Lurking beneath Turquoise Land,
they heed the ocarina's call.

00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:43.441
War Ocarina
has five tones and eight sounds.

00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:47.441
It governs heaven and earth
with the Dao as its score.

00:05:47.961 --> 00:05:52.081
Humans and fiends share paths,
merging into South Mountain.

00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:53.841
Were those Earth Demons

00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:55.521
summoned by you?

00:06:02.401 --> 00:06:05.201
I wanted to increase
our odds of success.

00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:06.922
But I never expected

00:06:07.081 --> 00:06:08.362
our South Mountain elders

00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:10.562
couldn't tell friend from foe.

00:06:15.984 --> 00:06:17.776
None of this matters now.

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:19.362
Seven hounds, two whips, and one blade.

00:06:19.441 --> 00:06:21.401
If ten of us fight one fiend,
we stand a chance.

00:06:21.401 --> 00:06:23.216
But now it's two fiends
against seven of us.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:23.952
What do we do?

00:06:25.042 --> 00:06:25.841
Fight to the death.

00:06:26.562 --> 00:06:28.081
Killing even one would count as a win.

00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:30.321
There's only this one exit anyway.

00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:32.841
Let's take them on.

00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:35.562
Xing Shen,

00:06:36.922 --> 00:06:37.641
give the order.

00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:41.961
Wu Qing, watch Quecha.

00:06:42.722 --> 00:06:43.362
Yu Rong,

00:06:44.281 --> 00:06:46.002
hold off the big one
at the cave entrance.

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:47.961
We'll break out together.

00:06:56.761 --> 00:06:57.401
Luo!

00:06:57.401 --> 00:06:58.042
Luo!

00:07:00.562 --> 00:07:01.362
What did you eat?

00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:05.761
It doesn't matter.

00:07:13.482 --> 00:07:14.362
Mad Blade medicine.

00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:20.362
Luo?

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:25.641
Luo?

00:07:40.122 --> 00:07:41.122
Luo!

Tuo,

00:13:20.554 --> 00:13:23.154
this is both a reunion and a farewell.

00:13:24.075 --> 00:13:26.394
Any last words for me?

00:13:35.995 --> 00:13:38.075
Yan Xin has been gone a long time.

00:13:38.075 --> 00:13:39.715
Now go join her.

00:14:03.995 --> 00:14:04.835
Have you forgotten?

00:14:05.715 --> 00:14:07.794
This can't kill me.

00:16:03.674 --> 00:16:04.355
Xinxin.

00:16:05.394 --> 00:16:06.835
Xinxin, where did you go?

00:16:07.554 --> 00:16:09.554
I never went anywhere.

00:16:09.674 --> 00:16:11.394
I've been right here.

00:16:11.394 --> 00:16:14.274
I'm perfectly fine. Don't worry.

00:16:14.995 --> 00:16:16.995
Good, good.

00:16:16.995 --> 00:16:19.955
Tuo, look how beautiful
it is over there.

00:16:19.955 --> 00:16:22.355
Let's go see together.

00:16:22.355 --> 00:16:23.555
No, Xinxin.

00:16:23.555 --> 00:16:24.115
Xinxin!

00:16:24.674 --> 00:16:26.795
Tuo, I'm very happy here.

00:16:26.795 --> 00:16:28.714
Everyone takes good care of me.

00:16:29.035 --> 00:16:30.275
Stop looking for me.

00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:33.035
Go back now. Goodbye.

00:16:33.275 --> 00:16:33.994
Xinxin!

00:18:04.394 --> 00:18:05.234
Where's Luo?

00:18:21.714 --> 00:18:24.835
A long-haired Earth Demon
killed Lin Xirou

00:18:26.394 --> 00:18:27.755
and then dragged Luo away.

00:18:31.875 --> 00:18:33.275
Everyone's badly injured.

00:18:34.634 --> 00:18:36.355
We feared
more Earth Fiends would appear.

00:18:38.115 --> 00:18:39.994
We couldn't continue
search and rescue efforts.

00:18:45.154 --> 00:18:47.515
Rong, we did our best.

00:18:48.555 --> 00:18:50.315
We only recovered the War Ocarina.

00:19:08.994 --> 00:19:10.115
Let's retreat

00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:11.835
and heal properly

00:19:12.515 --> 00:19:14.795
before resuming the search.

00:19:17.154 --> 00:19:19.275
Recall the team and take headcount.

00:19:19.755 --> 00:19:20.914
Copy that.

00:19:21.674 --> 00:19:22.795
Okay.

00:19:46.434 --> 00:19:48.434
L-Luo?

00:20:21.755 --> 00:20:22.555
Luo.

00:20:28.674 --> 00:20:29.434
Luo.

00:20:31.634 --> 00:20:32.234
Luo!

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:38.035
Somebody dumped you
at my place, no idea who.

00:20:38.595 --> 00:20:40.434
You've been out cold for a week.

00:20:41.835 --> 00:20:44.154
My Wanbao Tower's been closed
that whole time too.

00:20:45.154 --> 00:20:46.595
I'll tell you everything I know.

00:20:46.674 --> 00:20:47.755
Just one condition.

00:20:47.994 --> 00:20:49.194
Stay lying down, okay?

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:56.954
At first you were in a deep coma.

00:20:58.115 --> 00:21:00.795
I used every med
I could get my hands on.

00:21:00.795 --> 00:21:02.994
You only stabilized
these past couple of days.

00:21:04.674 --> 00:21:06.474
So your top priority now

00:21:07.674 --> 00:21:08.555
is sleeping.

00:21:09.755 --> 00:21:11.515
If you collapse again,

00:21:12.555 --> 00:21:14.035
I can't handle it again.

00:21:20.515 --> 00:21:21.275
What about Luo?

00:21:23.056 --> 00:21:24.795
I searched everywhere possible

00:21:25.795 --> 00:21:27.355
and asked around.

00:21:28.547 --> 00:21:29.627
No trace of her anywhere.

00:21:31.266 --> 00:21:33.147
Don't think I'm some hero doing this.

00:21:33.507 --> 00:21:34.388
It's mainly because

00:21:34.388 --> 00:21:36.507
you've mumbled her name
over 600 times in your coma.

00:21:37.787 --> 00:21:38.468
Drove me crazy.

00:21:47.948 --> 00:21:51.347
I've lost count of how many times
you've helped me.

00:21:52.388 --> 00:21:53.428
Save the thanks.

00:21:54.948 --> 00:21:56.787
Focus on getting your strength back

00:21:56.787 --> 00:21:58.067
and moving out from here

00:21:59.067 --> 00:22:00.228
to free up my bed.

00:22:01.188 --> 00:22:02.027
That matters most.

00:22:04.307 --> 00:22:06.148
You can get me
a commendation plaque later.

00:22:07.628 --> 00:22:09.388
No 'Healing Hands, Compassionate Heart'

00:22:10.628 --> 00:22:13.267
or 'Modern Hippocrates of Kos.'

00:22:13.267 --> 00:22:14.428
Too cliché.

00:22:15.748 --> 00:22:17.708
Go creative, like,

00:22:18.228 --> 00:22:20.388
'Xian, thank you for my second life.'

00:22:20.988 --> 00:22:23.787
'From the depths of my heart,
I call you Father.'

00:22:24.507 --> 00:22:26.628
That's the kind of heartfelt tribute
I'll take.

00:22:29.428 --> 00:22:30.507
Mind if I ask?

00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:33.547
Why are you

00:22:34.307 --> 00:22:35.547
doing all this?

00:22:51.075 --> 00:22:52.075
I'll show you something.

00:22:59.595 --> 00:23:00.716
This kid is me.

00:23:06.499 --> 00:23:07.139
This was my dad.

00:23:09.259 --> 00:23:11.378
He got leukemia young.

00:23:13.139 --> 00:23:14.378
Got lucky though.

00:23:15.338 --> 00:23:18.179
Found a volunteer marrow donor.

00:23:19.659 --> 00:23:20.778
But then somehow,

00:23:21.578 --> 00:23:22.778
right before the surgery,

00:23:23.219 --> 00:23:25.018
that kind soul vanished mysteriously.

00:23:26.739 --> 00:23:27.699
My dad didn't make it.

00:23:30.019 --> 00:23:34.019
My mom juggled work and raising me.

00:23:35.019 --> 00:23:36.100
She worked herself sick

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.019
and followed my dad within three years.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.220
You know the rest.

00:23:43.739 --> 00:23:45.620
Roadsound Group sponsored me

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:47.860
through school and graduation.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.299
And I opened Wanbao Tower smoothly.

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:53.499
Then one day

00:23:54.259 --> 00:23:55.739
I discovered

00:23:56.499 --> 00:23:58.698
that missing volunteer

00:23:58.698 --> 00:23:59.779
wasn't lost by accident.

00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:05.603
Lin Xirou snatched him as her blood bag.

00:24:12.035 --> 00:24:14.636
I saw Roadsound Group as my savior,

00:24:15.515 --> 00:24:16.876
but the very savior

00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:21.275
indirectly killed my real parents.

00:24:21.876 --> 00:24:23.556
Should I hate her?

00:24:24.995 --> 00:24:25.755
I can't.

00:24:27.795 --> 00:24:28.475
But loving her?

00:24:30.515 --> 00:24:31.995
That's impossible too.

00:24:36.116 --> 00:24:37.076
That's why I envy you.

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:39.475
You can love and hate fiercely.

00:24:40.755 --> 00:24:41.995
So I helped you.

00:24:44.356 --> 00:24:45.755
Helping you is helping myself.

00:24:57.539 --> 00:24:58.738
Luo said...

00:24:59.738 --> 00:25:00.339
Luo said

00:25:00.339 --> 00:25:02.619
she wanted to stop
by a cave temple on the way.

00:25:02.729 --> 00:25:04.019
She'll be back a few days late.

00:25:04.539 --> 00:25:06.178
I can't be away
from the company for long.

00:25:06.178 --> 00:25:07.259
So I came back first.

00:25:08.898 --> 00:25:09.619
It's okay.

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:12.779
Perfect timing. Ms. Lu
is making dumplings for us today.

00:25:13.019 --> 00:25:14.218
You can be the judge

00:25:14.339 --> 00:25:16.738
and decide whose dumplings taste better.

00:25:17.458 --> 00:25:19.218
Dumplings for departure,
noodles for arrival.

00:25:19.458 --> 00:25:20.859
Mr. Yan just got back.

00:25:20.938 --> 00:25:22.178
Don't make him eat dumplings.

00:25:22.738 --> 00:25:23.859
Everything's ready.

00:25:24.138 --> 00:25:25.019
Let's make dumplings

00:25:25.658 --> 00:25:27.458
and cook him a separate bowl of noodles.

00:25:28.138 --> 00:25:29.418
We shouldn't overstuff him.

00:25:29.738 --> 00:25:31.378
He's a young grown man.

00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:33.059
When I was his age,

00:25:33.218 --> 00:25:34.418
I ate noodles by the pot.

00:25:41.099 --> 00:25:41.658
Tuo,

00:25:42.499 --> 00:25:43.938
why not go to your room and rest?

00:25:44.417 --> 00:25:45.697
I'll call when the food's ready.

00:25:47.539 --> 00:25:48.178
Okay.

00:25:48.698 --> 00:25:49.579
I'll head over now.

00:26:24.483 --> 00:26:28.419
(Return Safely)

00:26:49.091 --> 00:26:51.747
(Practical Sculpture Techniques)

(Photo Album)

00:27:41.539 --> 00:27:42.258
Lu,

00:27:42.978 --> 00:27:44.539
I've already washed them.

00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:48.738
Look at me.

00:27:50.498 --> 00:27:51.899
I'm getting forgetful.

00:27:57.089 --> 00:27:58.089
Something on your mind?

00:28:02.899 --> 00:28:04.658
Miss Nie travels often.

00:28:05.779 --> 00:28:07.059
This isn't her first trip.

00:28:07.978 --> 00:28:10.299
But this time feels different.

00:28:10.978 --> 00:28:14.938
I've got this nagging unease.

00:28:20.835 --> 00:28:21.474
Ms. Lu.

00:28:22.155 --> 00:28:22.795
Ms. Lu.

00:28:24.395 --> 00:28:26.034
Ms. Lu, who is this person?

00:28:27.954 --> 00:28:29.155
Miss Nie's mother.

00:28:29.635 --> 00:28:30.274
What's wrong?

00:28:30.994 --> 00:28:32.034
Luo's mother?

00:28:32.835 --> 00:28:33.434
Yes.

00:30:46.114 --> 00:30:47.114
That's enough.

00:30:48.474 --> 00:30:49.154
Give it a rest.

00:30:51.795 --> 00:30:53.994
I'll decide when to rest

00:30:54.795 --> 00:30:55.634
and when to train.

00:30:57.474 --> 00:30:58.195
No problem.

00:30:59.835 --> 00:31:01.875
As long as you meet my standards.

00:31:03.514 --> 00:31:07.315
If I pass the Ghost Whip assessment,

00:31:08.235 --> 00:31:09.395
you'll stop nagging me?

00:31:11.554 --> 00:31:12.795
It's okay if you don't pass.

00:31:14.395 --> 00:31:15.755
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:31:24.154 --> 00:31:25.514
I will pass the assessment.

00:31:25.715 --> 00:31:27.034
The Hunters need me.

00:31:27.474 --> 00:31:28.594
And I will be there.

00:31:30.235 --> 00:31:34.954
But training, patrolling,
and ancestor rites

00:31:36.994 --> 00:31:39.355
are just formalities.

00:31:39.994 --> 00:31:42.315
Can I skip them from now on?

00:31:43.675 --> 00:31:44.954
Let's talk after the assessment.

(Jiang Baichuan)

00:32:23.835 --> 00:32:24.594
From now on,

00:32:25.875 --> 00:32:27.154
this will always be your home.

00:32:27.994 --> 00:32:29.434
And we'll always be your family.

Big Head

00:33:21.675 --> 00:33:23.915
got guarding down.

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:24.915
Shut up.

00:33:24.915 --> 00:33:28.675
Others have guard dogs,
and I have Big Head.

00:33:29.154 --> 00:33:30.554
Stop that.

00:33:30.755 --> 00:33:31.434
Cheeky.

00:33:32.514 --> 00:33:33.195
Shut up.

Ode to the South Mountain Hunters.

00:34:53.392 --> 00:34:57.040
Stars set on dark peaks.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:00.720
Fiends rise in Turquoise Land.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.112
Bound heads, sealed gold.

00:35:04.112 --> 00:35:07.664
We're sworn to defend our home.

00:35:07.664 --> 00:35:11.216
Ancient bloodlines.

00:35:11.216 --> 00:35:14.832
Share this toil.

00:35:14.832 --> 00:35:18.416
Golden Gate arises.

00:35:18.416 --> 00:35:22.224
Fate follows ancestors.

00:35:22.224 --> 00:35:26.384
South Mountain hunts shadows.

00:35:26.384 --> 00:35:30.032
Turquoise Land hides blades.

00:35:30.032 --> 00:35:33.456
Though hunters perish.

00:35:33.552 --> 00:35:37.072
The fiend hunt endures.

00:35:37.072 --> 00:35:40.560
Hound fangs tear night.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.144
Whip cracks echo skies.

00:35:44.144 --> 00:35:47.824
Bloodstained woods.

00:35:47.824 --> 00:35:51.664
Bonds for the ages.
