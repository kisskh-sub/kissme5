Xiaoyu, here is something

I don't quite understand as a guy.

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:04.648
I'm listening.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.609

I also received it.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.649
You sent it to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.250

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.729

Stop laughing at me.

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:33.449
It's fine. You spoke from the heart.

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.370
You didn't insult anyone.
Just let it be.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.250

You're doomed.

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.250
Ms. Bai hates voice messages.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.810
Inefficient and unprofessional.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.489
And you sent three in a row.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.929
"I don't regret it."

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.329

When we apply for arbitration

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.329
of share repurchase,

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.530
we should name

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.729
(Arbitration Target)
Hong Da as the respondent.

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:28.370
Otherwise, as per the Company Law,

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.290
National Court Conference Minutes
on Civil and Commercial Trials etc.,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.410
we may fail to meet the client's demands

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.209
if capital reduction occurs.

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.169
(Property Preservation)
My approach

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.329
aligns with Ren Jiatong's.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.329
And at the same time,

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.370
we should file for

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.570
asset preservation
to freeze Hong Da's assets.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.850
Otherwise, we could win

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.810
but end up with nothing to collect.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.584
(Property Preservation)
Thank you.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.370
Ren Jiatong
and Yan Fei's ideas are both solid.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.690
They noted the inability

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:01.889
to directly demand

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.010
stock repurchase from the new company.

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.889
But you should also notice that

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.090
the repurchase price

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.169
stipulated

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.769
in the contract far exceeds

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.769
what our client paid

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.489
when establishing the new company.

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.090
Even in commercial arbitration,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.769
it's unlikely to be fully upheld.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.889
Therefore,

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.769
keep following up on this point.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:27.889
Alright, it's late.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.649
Let's talk...

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:29.384
Mr. Zhou.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.969
My turn.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.810
I won't take much time.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.960
(Property Preservation)

00:04:55.196 --> 00:04:56.250
(Key contract clauses)

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.730
I noticed that the contract

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:58.690
also grants

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.170
a drag-along right if the new company

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:02.289
underperforms.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.880
(Drag-along right)

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.512
(A provision that allows
a majority or key shareholder)

00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:06.344
(to force minority shareholders)

00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:07.912
(to join in the sale of the company to
a third party, under the same terms.)

00:05:07.912 --> 00:05:08.840
(The minority shareholders
are to comply.)

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.570
(Thus, this right is mandatory
for them.)

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.889
So I suggest we advise our client

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.610
to exercise the drag-along right

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:15.649
to sell both its own

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.810
(Hong Da, Client)
and Hong Da's shares

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.810
(Mandatory Equity Transfer)
in the new company

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.616
(Equity Transfer)
to Xin Jian Ye,

00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:21.128
(Xin Jian Ye)

00:05:21.128 --> 00:05:23.370
(Critical Supply Chain Component)
which has previously expressed interest

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.610
(Enforce Co-Transfer)
in acquiring a larger stake.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.209
(Hong Da loses control)
Should Hong Da refuse to comply,

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.769
we would then initiate arbitration
to enforce the drag-along clause.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.250
Interesting.

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.329
Compared to Ren Jiatong and Yan Fei's

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.370
direct approach
to demand share repurchase,

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.209
your solution seems

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.250
more indirect.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.409
Yeah, that's why I didn't

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:45.849
pursue the approach

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.529
with the drag-along right.

00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:49.810
(Drag-along right)

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.408
I believe

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.730
although the drag-along approach

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.329
may seem to be less direct,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.170
it allows the client

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.409
to receive funds faster.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.930
Our client can achieve equity transfer

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:02.849
without waiting for arbitration.

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:03.969
Ultimately,

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:05.490
(Prompt Payment)
a prompt receipt

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:07.329
of satisfactory payment

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:09.449
is the client's core need.

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.250
Plus, payments via this approach

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.889
avoid arbitration-ordered reductions.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.810
(Unaffected by arbitration reduction)
It addresses

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.730
the concern raised by

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.170
Mr. Zhou, Ren Jiatong, and Yan Fei.

00:06:21.627 --> 00:06:22.248
(Arbitral reduction)

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:23.208
(Upon a party's request,)

00:06:23.208 --> 00:06:24.200
(the arbitral tribunal
exercises its discretion)

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.256
(to appropriately reduce
an excessive or unreasonable sum)

00:06:25.256 --> 00:06:26.170
(based on statutory law
and the principle of fairness.)

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.329
There's something I don't understand.

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:29.170
Our client company

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.649
has already transferred
its shares to Xin Jian Ye

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:32.730
and received the payment.

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:35.490
Why are we initiating arbitration,

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.529
demanding the drag-along
of Hong Da's shares?

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.409
Apart from the payment

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.370
made by Xin Jian Ye,

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.050
we want to secure

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.529
a settlement payment
from Hong Da for our client.

00:06:45.692 --> 00:06:46.250
(Settlement payment)

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.730
If arbitration upholds
the drag-along right clause,

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:49.690
that would mean

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.170
Hong Da loses control

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.370
over the new company.

00:06:52.488 --> 00:06:54.209
And that new company happens to be

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:56.610
the apparel supply chain business.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.490
Although it hasn't met targets
in the last two years,

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.690
it's crucial for companies

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.329
in the apparel industry, like Hong Da

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.409
and Xin Jian Ye.

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:05.690
This is why

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.250
Xin Jian Ye is trying to

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.930
hold a larger stake in the new company.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.050
And this is what Hong Da

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.329
can't possibly accept.

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:15.250
Therefore,

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.490
I believe Hong Da

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.849
will seek a settlement,

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.969
and request our client

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.209
not to exercise the drag-along right.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.289
At that time, we can secure

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:25.849
a settlement payment for our client.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.329
Yeah, not just the settlement payment.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.889
Hong Da might also agree

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:31.889
to our client's original proposal

00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:35.050
and repurchase the shares
our client holds in the new company.

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:36.529
The drag-along right

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.690
is Hong Da's true fear.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.449
Someone is so eager to defend

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:42.849
his junior colleague.

00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:53.089
Ren Jiatong and Yan Fei suggest

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:54.329
we directly demand

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:57.570
compensation and repurchase
through arbitration.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.289
But Li Ke has chosen to

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.570
advance the transfer

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:04.010
while adopting
"Litigation to Drive Negotiation"

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.050
as a pressure tactic

00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:08.209
to prompt negotiation and compensation.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.490
I believe this will

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.969
resolve the issue more efficiently.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.570
Good idea.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:21.889
After discussion,

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.370
we've decided
to award the points to Li Ke.

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:25.690
And you can go on

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.170
a business trip with Ms. Bai.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.064
Congrats.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.090
Li Ke is not bad.

00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:48.730
Indeed.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:49.736
Mr. Zhuang.

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:50.792
Ms. Bai.

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:52.409
Mr. Zhou.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.056
Well,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.809
my sister sent me some fresh walnuts.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.049
They're really nice.

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:00.370
It would be hard to crack them open

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.529
so she went ahead

00:09:01.529 --> 00:09:02.730
and did it one by one.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.809
I'll bring you some.

00:09:05.409 --> 00:09:06.730
Your sister is so thoughtful.

00:09:07.809 --> 00:09:09.130
She deserves some credit

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:10.490
for your great proposal.

00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:13.409
She worked hard to crack them open

00:09:13.409 --> 00:09:14.330
one by one.

00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:16.130
We'll definitely enjoy them.

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:17.409
Thank you.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.010
Thank your sister for me.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.970
Thank you.

00:09:51.548 --> 00:09:54.632
(Review notes)

00:10:05.096 --> 00:10:07.720
(Is it done? How was it?)

00:10:10.312 --> 00:10:11.592
(I. Case objectives)

00:10:11.592 --> 00:10:14.664
(My approach was to secure
the share transfer...)

00:10:17.755 --> 00:10:18.600
(Review notes)

00:10:35.816 --> 00:10:36.520
Come in.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:38.632
Ms. Bai.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.769
I found a pen in the conference room.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:41.929
I think it's yours.

00:10:41.929 --> 00:10:43.130
Did you leave it behind?

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.289
It is mine. Thank you.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.010
I've been looking for it.

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:51.370
Right,

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.210
the meeting's over.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.330
What were you doing there?

00:10:53.929 --> 00:10:55.330
I drafted a review note

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.529
and emailed it to you.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.850
I'd welcome your feedback

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.090
if you have time.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.889
Feels awful to lose, huh?

00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:07.010
Yeah.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.289
It's not the first time,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.569
but I still don't like it.

00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:15.330
What if I tell you that you'll

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:15.929
get used to it

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.769
after a while?

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.929
I will never get used to it.

00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:22.649
I don't think

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.769
you'd like an apprentice
who admits defeat.

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:28.610
I'm just one of
your supervising lawyers.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:30.049
The apprenticeship

00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:31.649
comes down to fate.

00:11:36.689 --> 00:11:37.970
Sit down, let's talk.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.169
It was

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:44.569
a competition between you three.

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:46.689
But it seems you've focused

00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:47.970
only on Yan Fei.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.032
Why?

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.250
I think you know very well

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:54.490
that the Talent Hunt Program candidates

00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:55.450
are all competent.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.809
In the past few months, you've been

00:11:57.809 --> 00:11:58.529
working hard.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.889
You believe you can win
with your expertise

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.970
and abilities.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.450
But Yan Fei

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.610
is a unique opponent.

00:12:06.049 --> 00:12:07.210
Because deep down,

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.010
you feel she possesses something

00:12:10.409 --> 00:12:11.730
that no amount of hard work

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.210
can ever give you.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.090
You hate to lose to her.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.809
That's why you poured

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:18.490
all your focus on her alone

00:12:18.569 --> 00:12:19.809
and overlooked Li Ke.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.370
Am I right?

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.090
Good. Recognizing the problem

00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:31.409
means you've taken a step forward.

00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:34.250
Never underestimate any opponent

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.010
and never overestimate one either.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:38.664
Come on.

00:12:38.769 --> 00:12:39.330
Walnuts.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.370
- Thanks.
- They're tasty.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.569
I heard that

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.970
you killed it today.

00:12:44.289 --> 00:12:45.569
Shouldn't you treat us?

00:12:45.809 --> 00:12:47.769
Check the group chat. Bubble teas on me.

00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:48.689
- Go ahead.
- Already done.

00:12:49.768 --> 00:12:50.490
Alright.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.529
But I'm interviewing

00:12:51.529 --> 00:12:52.769
someone with Jiang Chen.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.370
Leave the bubble tea on my desk.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.809
I want your winning aura.

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:56.409
No problem.

00:12:58.289 --> 00:12:59.010
Jiang Chen,

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.450
Mr. Hu is waiting.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.010
I'll revise my review notes.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:09.864
Ms. Bai,

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:12.010
thank you for your advice.

00:13:12.409 --> 00:13:12.929
It's nothing.

00:13:13.409 --> 00:13:15.450
Just consider it my thanks
for finding my pen.

00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:19.809
This pen must be very special to you.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.769
A friend gave it to me.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.569
Out of everyone at Jun An,

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:27.889
I'm the one who found

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:28.970
such an important pen.

00:13:29.169 --> 00:13:29.970
That's fate.

00:13:31.569 --> 00:13:32.210
Thank you, mentor.

00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:41.224
Ren Jiatong.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:41.970
Here.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.049
Walnuts from home.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.929
Super good.

00:13:43.929 --> 00:13:44.889
Freshly shelled.

00:13:44.889 --> 00:13:45.409
Here.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.920
Thanks.

00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:50.049
I learned a lot today.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.889
Your performance is inspiring.

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:55.409
I'm flattered.

00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:56.610
I don't even know

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.730
what to say now.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.024
Have a seat.

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:29.370
We're here

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.850
to learn about

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.010
your business operations with

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.010
your subsidiaries.

00:14:34.169 --> 00:14:34.824
(Beijing Zhong Yuan)
So...

00:14:35.769 --> 00:14:37.889
We operate fully within the law,

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:38.769
pay all the taxes,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.010
(and fulfill
all corporate responsibilities.)

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.409
(We've been long established.)

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:44.456
Besides,

00:14:44.929 --> 00:14:47.049
our company deeply cares

00:14:47.289 --> 00:14:48.970
for our employees.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.409
We've also received honorary titles like

00:14:52.529 --> 00:14:53.809
Outstanding Taxpaying Enterprise

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.569
(and Customer Satisfaction Enterprise.)

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.850
(These awards)

00:14:59.889 --> 00:15:01.649
(are displayed on our honor wall.)

00:15:04.539 --> 00:15:06.728
(2023 Tian Yu Software
Outstanding Taxpaying Enterprise)

00:15:09.809 --> 00:15:10.376
Mr. Hu,

00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:12.330
while reviewing Zhong Yuan's

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.929
business contracts yesterday,

00:15:13.929 --> 00:15:15.250
I discovered an addendum.

00:15:15.649 --> 00:15:16.850
But it conflicts

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.210
with the terms of

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.130
the main contract.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.569
So, I suspect this is a dual contract.

00:15:22.049 --> 00:15:24.130
Zhong Yuan intended to conceal this fact

00:15:24.289 --> 00:15:25.450
and has been showing us

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:26.529
the public version,

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.010
but they made a mistake
when handing in the files

00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:31.289
and submitted the addendum,

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.689
which is the private contract.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.010
The addendum was buried

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.409
within that stack of files.

00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:36.689
They assumed we wouldn't

00:15:36.689 --> 00:15:37.649
go through all of them.

00:15:38.169 --> 00:15:39.970
Yet I managed to dig it out.

00:15:43.769 --> 00:15:44.610
I'll include this

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.250
in the due diligence report

00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:48.169
and flag the risks to our client.

00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:49.480
Mr. Hu.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.569
I took a photo of this certificate

00:15:51.569 --> 00:15:52.569
during our visit

00:15:52.689 --> 00:15:54.330
at Zhong Yuan that day.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.169
Please take a look.

00:15:55.169 --> 00:15:57.169
(Outstanding Taxpaying Enterprise)
It shows that

00:15:57.169 --> 00:15:58.809
Tian Yu was once a municipal-level

00:15:58.809 --> 00:16:00.529
outstanding taxpayer.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.049
So it was a lie when Zhong Yuan

00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:03.409
said it was a shell company

00:16:03.409 --> 00:16:04.689
that had no business dealings

00:16:04.689 --> 00:16:05.929
with them.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:06.649
Yeah.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.929
Without substantial income,

00:16:08.929 --> 00:16:10.490
there wouldn't be significant taxes.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.010
Those liars.

00:16:12.529 --> 00:16:13.130
Impressive.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.610
No wonder Mr. Song recommended you.

00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:15.769
Impressive new talent.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:16.610
Really?

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.569
Please tell Mr. Song

00:16:18.569 --> 00:16:19.970
that exact praise in person.

00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:21.330
Please.

00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:22.450
Bubble tea on me.

00:16:22.696 --> 00:16:23.330
Don't worry.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.010
If Mr. Song doesn't credit your team,

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.130
I'll appeal to him.

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:28.569
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:16:34.649 --> 00:16:35.250
Small world.

00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:38.689
Why are you here?

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.450
You challenged me to spar

00:16:40.529 --> 00:16:42.330
and recommended this gym and coach.

00:16:42.409 --> 00:16:43.112
Did you forget?

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:46.330
Bring it on.

00:16:46.809 --> 00:16:47.610
No, winning you

00:16:47.769 --> 00:16:48.730
would be dishonorable.

00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:51.850
Come on, it's nothing shameful to lose.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:53.569
Want a headgear?

00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:55.210
Why would I need that?

00:16:55.409 --> 00:16:56.289
Do you need one?

00:16:57.929 --> 00:16:59.889
At the firm, you're my supervisor.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.330
But at the gym,

00:17:01.409 --> 00:17:02.689
I'm your senior.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:03.624
Fine.

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:04.584
Senior.

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:06.690
Looking forward to your guidance.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.056
(Fight Club)

00:17:35.049 --> 00:17:35.569
Senior.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.450
Your training hasn't paid off.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:14.920
Your nose is bleeding.

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:26.440
Thanks.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.529
That was brutal.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:32.849
That punch of yours

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.170
nearly cost me my civil capacity.

00:18:35.809 --> 00:18:37.289
Because you didn't wear headgear.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:38.650
Alright.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.410
It's my fault.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.650
I'm sorry.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.450
I was desperate to win.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.049
Here at the gym or at the firm?

00:18:48.089 --> 00:18:48.690
Both.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.490
I just don't get it.

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:54.089
I've pushed myself to absolute limits.

00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:56.289
Yet I always fall just short.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.569
Where am I lacking?

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.170
I really don't get it.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:01.329
Nowhere.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.569
I know

00:19:03.369 --> 00:19:05.569
people are polite to me at the firm

00:19:05.569 --> 00:19:07.250
because of my family background.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:08.809
I bet you think

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.890
I'm just a spoiled heiress

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:12.970
with nothing but money and tantrums.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:16.170
If I must describe you,

00:19:16.569 --> 00:19:19.010
you're passionate, brilliant,

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.410
and fearlessly principled.

00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:23.129
You're impressive.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.010
You've never considered quitting.

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:26.289
From my perspective,

00:19:27.329 --> 00:19:29.089
you performed exceptionally this time.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:30.690
A setback or two

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.609
doesn't matter.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:32.730
That's the beauty

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:34.329
of boxing, too.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.730
As long as the fighter

00:19:36.129 --> 00:19:37.089
can still get back up,

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.450
they have a chance to win.

00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:41.730
Really?

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:42.769
Yeah.

00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:44.569
Zhou?

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:46.472
Coach.

00:19:46.569 --> 00:19:47.690
Why are you here today?

00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:49.730
I thought you'd only come

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.490
on Thursday.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:52.410
Isn't it Wednesday?

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:54.769
I have work tomorrow.

00:19:55.609 --> 00:19:56.329
Go ahead, coach.

00:19:56.329 --> 00:19:57.250
I can practice alone.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.410
Did you come to keep me company?

00:20:13.569 --> 00:20:16.010
And you let me punch you on purpose?

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.250
The coach shared the video
in the boxing group.

00:20:19.809 --> 00:20:21.289
You were training too hard.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.329
So I came here.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.129
Did my brother

00:20:26.129 --> 00:20:28.289
tell you to do that?

00:20:28.609 --> 00:20:30.890
Whenever Xingke's heiress feels down,

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.490
the supervising lawyers must
clear their schedule to cheer her up.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.010
How much do you charge?

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:39.690
I'm your supervising lawyer.

00:20:40.849 --> 00:20:42.010
I am held responsible

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.010
if you're upset

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:44.329
during work.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:46.490
This applies

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:47.410
to every single

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:48.809
one of you.

00:20:50.289 --> 00:20:52.010
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.410
You're a decent guy.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.690
How come your ex never tried

00:20:56.289 --> 00:20:58.129
to review your relationship?

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.289
I'm a single workaholic

00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:02.490
consumed by work.

00:21:02.809 --> 00:21:04.250
I've devoted myself to Jun An.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:05.890
All I review right now

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.049
are case files.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.450
Wordplay? That's a fine.

00:21:10.089 --> 00:21:10.930
You can't fine me.

00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:12.650
You're quite decent too.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.129
I bet you held back on that punch.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.970
Or I'd be lying on the floor.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.529
I am

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:21.609
hot-tempered and sharp-tongued.

00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:22.569
I know that.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:24.129
But I've never met anyone

00:21:24.129 --> 00:21:25.010
like you

00:21:25.089 --> 00:21:27.289
who never gets angry at my words.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.450
Plus, you always show up

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.250
when needed.

00:21:31.329 --> 00:21:33.210
So you're decent, too.

00:21:34.329 --> 00:21:35.080
Alright.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:36.456
I'm off.

00:21:37.369 --> 00:21:38.049
Want a ride?

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:39.624
No need.

00:21:40.369 --> 00:21:43.930
I'm going back to the firm.
I'm only walking you to your car.

00:21:45.569 --> 00:21:46.184
Bye.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:58.730
I've been looking for you.
There you are.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:21:59.930
What's wrong?

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:02.450
Could I borrow the original copy

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:03.450
of the demand letter?

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.129
The log says you have it.

00:22:05.129 --> 00:22:05.930
I need to copy it.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:06.970
It's here.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.809
Take it yourself.

00:22:07.809 --> 00:22:08.569
I made copies.

00:22:08.849 --> 00:22:10.049
I'm shredding these papers.

00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:17.736
Got a cold?

00:22:18.329 --> 00:22:19.970
It's fine. No fever. Nothing serious.

00:22:27.803 --> 00:22:29.628
(Shareholder
Capital Contribution Agreement)

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:33.160
Here.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.289
Drink this when it cools.

00:22:35.529 --> 00:22:37.450
It's great for early symptoms.

00:22:38.329 --> 00:22:38.849
Thanks.

00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:42.170
You didn't get a bubble tea

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:43.329
this afternoon.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.490
Consider this a substitute.

00:22:47.547 --> 00:22:48.936
(Repurchase of Shares)

00:22:52.369 --> 00:22:53.450
It's my sister.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.248
Hey, sis.

00:22:59.049 --> 00:22:59.970
Yeah, I got them.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.250
I shared the walnuts with my colleagues.

00:23:05.129 --> 00:23:06.890
Mr. Zhuang praised you today.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.569
Okay.

00:23:10.129 --> 00:23:11.450
Sis, I'm at the office.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.010
Call you after work.

00:23:14.049 --> 00:23:14.664
Okay.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.730
I know.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.010
Alright, bye.

00:23:23.049 --> 00:23:24.569
You two are really close.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.089
Yeah, she's amazing.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.010
Being a lawyer

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:30.650
was always her dream.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.650
Did she study law too?

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.049
Not really.

00:23:34.329 --> 00:23:35.690
But she loved the legal dramas

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.170
of Hong Kong, China.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.490
The lawyers' outfits in court

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:40.410
were impressive.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.809
She covered her pencil case

00:23:42.809 --> 00:23:44.250
with stickers of those shows.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.769
But she started working at a young age

00:23:46.769 --> 00:23:47.890
to support my education

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.129
and raise her kids.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:50.970
She signed me up

00:23:51.089 --> 00:23:51.890
for this program.

00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:53.450
No wonder

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.609
you're so caring.

00:23:55.609 --> 00:23:56.930
You learned that from her.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.369
Life has been hard on her.

00:23:59.769 --> 00:24:00.809
Whenever her child

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.049
got sick,

00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:03.490
she'd stay up around the clock.

00:24:04.089 --> 00:24:05.410
I didn't think of it at first.

00:24:05.609 --> 00:24:06.569
But then, I realized

00:24:06.569 --> 00:24:08.329
that we must have some medicine on hand.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:10.450
You're pretty amazing.

00:24:10.769 --> 00:24:12.809
You notice details others miss.

00:24:13.569 --> 00:24:14.730
Your proposal

00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:16.450
was truly outstanding.

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:19.410
Are you okay?

00:24:19.849 --> 00:24:21.049
You're praising me again.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.210
Should I post about this?

00:24:23.609 --> 00:24:24.450
Visible only

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:25.450
to Jiang Chen.

00:24:28.188 --> 00:24:29.480
(Mr. Lin)

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.160
Oh no!

00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:38.809
Sorry, I wasted it.

00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:39.650
It's okay.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:40.769
Answer the call.

00:24:40.769 --> 00:24:41.410
I got this.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:42.129
Sorry.

00:24:42.129 --> 00:24:42.632
It's fine.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.369
Hello, Mr. Lin.

00:24:56.529 --> 00:24:57.289
I've put

00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:58.490
the original file back.

00:24:58.809 --> 00:24:59.930
I'll head home now.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:01.849
I'll stay.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:03.569
What's wrong?

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:05.809
You seem off

00:25:05.809 --> 00:25:06.730
since that call.

00:25:08.609 --> 00:25:09.256
It's nothing.

00:25:10.089 --> 00:25:10.728
Alright then.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:13.288
Ren Jiatong.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:15.849
I know why you want to win.

00:25:17.289 --> 00:25:17.809
I can relate.

00:25:24.609 --> 00:25:26.250
I didn't get your bubble tea today.

00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:27.970
But thank you

00:25:28.129 --> 00:25:28.776
for the walnuts.

00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:30.609
Thank your sister too.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:36.010
Take some medicine.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:37.890
I'm leaving. Bye.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.089
How do you know I'm here?

00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:19.490
You didn't reply to my text.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.010
Your things are still there.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.369
So you didn't leave.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:24.890
So I thought that you might

00:26:25.089 --> 00:26:25.849
be here.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:26.792
I was right.

00:26:29.129 --> 00:26:29.769
Drink with me

00:26:29.769 --> 00:26:30.690
since you're here.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:32.450
So unconstrained.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.010
But it's only 5% alcohol.

00:26:36.129 --> 00:26:37.410
Trying to get drunk or not?

00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:40.730
I want to get drunk,

00:26:41.049 --> 00:26:42.450
but I have work tomorrow.

00:26:43.129 --> 00:26:44.930
I have review notes to write.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.609
So many things to do.

00:26:46.609 --> 00:26:47.890
I can't let myself get drunk.

00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:50.210
Relax, I'll drink with you.

00:27:04.849 --> 00:27:05.970
Ms. Bai said that

00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:07.890
I feel inferior because of Yan Fei.

00:27:08.569 --> 00:27:09.569
She's only partly right.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.010
The person I envy is you.

00:27:15.569 --> 00:27:16.168
Me?

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.010
I envy you for having a lawyer father.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:22.536
Seriously.

00:27:23.129 --> 00:27:24.690
You can do anything you want.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:26.250
But I can't.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.329
Remember when you asked me

00:27:31.089 --> 00:27:33.170
about the side job I got outside Jun An?

00:27:33.369 --> 00:27:34.250
You told me it was

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:35.170
your dad's friend.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:37.890
Not just a friend.

00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:40.650
He's our creditor.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:43.129
My dad was indebted to his dad

00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:44.450
and couldn't repay.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:46.250
So I have to pay up.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.329
I suspected a little, but

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.250
I didn't expect...

00:27:56.329 --> 00:27:57.529
That it was so bad.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:01.690
Let the seniors
handle their own problems.

00:28:02.289 --> 00:28:04.569
You don't need to carry

00:28:04.569 --> 00:28:05.569
such a heavy burden.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.490
But it was my dad's wish.

00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:15.010
He died eight years ago.

00:28:15.089 --> 00:28:16.450
This is the only thing

00:28:16.809 --> 00:28:18.329
I can do for him.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:21.289
I'm afraid that one day,

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.329
all traces will be gone
as if he never existed

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:26.529
in this world.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:27.890
No way.

00:28:29.329 --> 00:28:31.129
As long as those who love him remain,

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:32.930
he will never vanish.

00:28:34.049 --> 00:28:34.569
You

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.289
and your mom won't let him fade away.

00:28:39.089 --> 00:28:40.410
Remember me.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:42.312
Right?

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:45.930
My mom?

00:28:48.369 --> 00:28:49.289
She remarried.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:51.129
Just now I received

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.529
a call from her current husband.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.129
He's actually not a bad person.

00:28:55.129 --> 00:28:55.769
But we

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.490
hardly ever speak.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:00.970
Can you believe it?

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.490
Someone who never calls me

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:04.450
just told me

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.010
to call my mom when I'm free.

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.809
I always ignore her calls.

00:29:10.289 --> 00:29:11.289
So she's worried.

00:29:11.809 --> 00:29:13.210
She hasn't been well lately.

00:29:14.369 --> 00:29:15.210
It's absurd.

00:29:19.289 --> 00:29:21.049
That's why you're upset today?

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:24.609
I'm not sure.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.650
But I have this feeling,

00:29:30.089 --> 00:29:30.690
you know?

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:31.490
It's like

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.890
everyone has rushed ahead.

00:29:36.369 --> 00:29:38.369
Only my dad and I are stuck in the past.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:43.609
I'm scared

00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:45.849
I'll be homeless.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.104
No way.

00:29:51.849 --> 00:29:52.520
You have me.

00:29:56.369 --> 00:29:56.970
I'm with you.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.010
It's late.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:06.930
Let's head back.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:19.450
Thank you

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:20.930
for keeping me company.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.849
Don't overthink it. Get some rest.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:33.049
Jiang Chen,

00:31:34.089 --> 00:31:35.450
I want to fight to the end.

00:31:40.609 --> 00:31:41.129
I understand.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:47.210
Thank you.

00:31:51.849 --> 00:31:52.456
Good night.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:16.730
(A key file)

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.170
(is missing in the Hong Da case.)

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:18.970
Ren Jiatong,

00:32:19.369 --> 00:32:20.129
were you the last

00:32:20.129 --> 00:32:21.609
to handle the original demand letter?

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:25.170
Aside from me, Li Ke also accessed it.

00:32:26.849 --> 00:32:28.849
I was the one
who borrowed the original copy.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.210
After I scanned it,

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.129
Ren Jiatong also took it to make a copy.

00:32:32.609 --> 00:32:33.730
There were many documents.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.569
I counted them all and put them back

00:32:35.569 --> 00:32:36.849
in the evidence box.

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:38.849
Then I left.

00:32:40.809 --> 00:32:42.170
Ren Jiatong stayed in the office.

00:32:44.089 --> 00:32:45.490
S-She was the last to leave.

00:32:46.289 --> 00:32:48.089
I didn't touch that file again, though.

00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:50.569
Should we check
the surveillance footage?

00:32:50.849 --> 00:32:51.464
Yeah,

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:52.450
let's check it.

00:32:53.289 --> 00:32:53.970
We did that.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:55.730
But they placed the evidence box

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:56.690
in a blind spot

00:32:56.809 --> 00:32:57.329
yesterday.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.930
Since there is no surveillance footage,

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.170
we must report to

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.010
the Talent Hunt Program overseers.

00:33:08.569 --> 00:33:10.250
Mr. Zhuang, Mr. Song, and I

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.369
will come up with

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:13.010
a solution.

00:33:13.769 --> 00:33:14.809
For now,

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:15.650
you're on hold.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:16.769
During this period,

00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:18.369
don't take on any tasks.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.089
What happened?

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.609
The demand letter

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.569
of the Hong Da case is missing.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.809
Ren Jiatong and I
were the last to handle it.

00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:53.250
Only you two were here last night.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.369
Evidence doesn't vanish into thin air.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:56.650
It's either you or...

00:33:59.569 --> 00:34:00.650
So they're trying

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.730
to determine
which one of you is accountable.

00:34:19.169 --> 00:34:19.752
Jiang Chen.

00:34:20.529 --> 00:34:21.529
I saw you returning

00:34:21.529 --> 00:34:22.209
when I left.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:23.490
Ren Jiatong was

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:24.529
the last to leave, right?

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.450
Stop speculating.

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:37.049
Let's try to help

00:34:37.049 --> 00:34:37.810
after work.

00:34:59.609 --> 00:35:00.850
Jiatong, take it easy.

00:35:01.169 --> 00:35:02.330
All these top talents

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:03.810
have seen everything at Jun An.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:05.410
They will find out the truth.

00:35:08.209 --> 00:35:09.249
What's wrong? You okay?

00:35:09.729 --> 00:35:10.490
Do me a favor.

00:35:10.729 --> 00:35:11.330
Stand here.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.930
I want to recreate
what happened that night.

00:35:14.249 --> 00:35:14.920
Got it.

00:35:20.249 --> 00:35:21.249
Could it be that

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:22.930
someone opened the window last night?

00:35:23.249 --> 00:35:24.330
Maybe the wind

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.689
blew the paper to the ground.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.450
How could the file just vanish?

00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:37.490
You think it got shredded by accident?

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.649
Li Ke was closer to the shredder.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:44.089
He did it?

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.209
It could also have been me.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.010
I got distracted answering a call.

00:35:55.249 --> 00:35:56.729
Not a great call, either.

00:35:57.089 --> 00:35:58.649
Then I came back to work.

00:35:59.209 --> 00:36:00.330
If I had taken the papers

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.129
unconsciously over to the shredder,

00:36:02.129 --> 00:36:03.169
it's totally possible.

00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:05.569
But I don't remember.

00:36:06.649 --> 00:36:07.209
Also,

00:36:08.529 --> 00:36:09.490
I drank last night.

00:36:10.529 --> 00:36:12.290
Of course, I want to prove it wasn't me.

00:36:14.049 --> 00:36:15.169
But it can't be Li Ke.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:16.169
He wouldn't lie.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:26.689
You're having a fever.

00:36:27.649 --> 00:36:29.529
Either way, we need evidence.

00:36:30.169 --> 00:36:31.249
I have to find proof.

00:36:31.609 --> 00:36:32.330
You're unwell.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.569
You should go home and rest.

00:36:38.088 --> 00:36:40.520
(Jiang Chen)

00:36:41.529 --> 00:36:42.088
Hello.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:43.490
Xiaoyu.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:44.609
Are you with Ren Jiatong?

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:45.609
Where are you?

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:48.930
I'm in the print room

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:49.770
with Jiatong.

00:36:53.689 --> 00:36:55.049
I know you're under pressure

00:36:55.049 --> 00:36:56.249
to prove your innocence.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.450
But you have a fever.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.810
Health comes first, right?

00:36:59.249 --> 00:37:00.490
Ms. Bai said you shouldn't

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.410
do anything

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.370
during this period.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:03.609
Just go home and rest.

00:37:03.729 --> 00:37:04.850
I'll keep an eye on Ms. Bai

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:05.970
and Mr. Zhou, okay?

00:37:06.649 --> 00:37:08.290
What's the point of that?

00:37:08.609 --> 00:37:10.569
I have to find the evidence

00:37:10.569 --> 00:37:12.169
and prove my innocence.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.850
Nothing anyone says will help.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:18.536
Ms. Bai.

00:37:18.689 --> 00:37:19.649
Ren Jiatong has a fever

00:37:19.649 --> 00:37:20.930
but she refuses to rest.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.649
Failing to rest when needed

00:37:23.729 --> 00:37:25.370
is stupider than slacking off.

00:37:26.209 --> 00:37:27.089
I'm really fine.

00:37:27.569 --> 00:37:28.968
I won't keep a disobedient trainee.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:30.376
I'll listen.

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.129
I'll go home now.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.129
Let's see a doctor.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.729
No need. I'll just take some medicine.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.169
It's not the end of the world.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.850
Take a short break.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.450
It's going to be fine.

00:38:35.609 --> 00:38:36.410
Stop comforting me.

00:38:36.649 --> 00:38:37.410
I can handle this.

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:39.490
I wouldn't bother comforting you.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.609
Someone asked me to ease your mind

00:38:42.649 --> 00:38:44.729
and get you home safely.

00:38:45.729 --> 00:38:46.850
Thank Guo Xiaoyu for me.

00:38:47.689 --> 00:38:48.890
She's much younger than me,

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:50.089
yet she's taking care of me.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:51.450
I'm a bit embarrassed.

00:38:52.729 --> 00:38:56.410
She's not the only one
who cares about you.

00:38:58.529 --> 00:38:59.169
Thank you too.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:03.432
Right,

00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:05.129
did Ms. Bai tell you how long

00:39:05.169 --> 00:39:06.410
you'll have to wait?

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:09.569
She said she'd discuss it
with Mr. Zhuang and Mr. Song.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:11.850
Mr. Song will be back in two days.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:14.930
The results for this round
will be announced then.

00:39:16.169 --> 00:39:18.089
I've never seen you so flustered before.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.490
Because I'm not sure

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:26.490
if it was my mistake.

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:31.249
Even if it was,

00:39:32.049 --> 00:39:32.970
it wasn't intentional.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:36.609
I hate this powerless feeling.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:38.689
Ever since my dad died,

00:39:38.689 --> 00:39:39.649
I've told myself

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:42.089
never to put myself

00:39:42.089 --> 00:39:43.569
in such a passive situation again.

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:45.609
So no matter what happens,

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.890
I try my best to keep my life and work

00:39:48.209 --> 00:39:49.729
under my control.

00:39:50.312 --> 00:39:50.890
But...

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:51.689
But

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:52.970
you're human, not a god.

00:39:53.729 --> 00:39:55.010
Don't push yourself so hard.

00:40:15.089 --> 00:40:15.890
We're here.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.890
Take some medicine and sleep tight.

00:40:18.569 --> 00:40:20.249
It might be a brand new day tomorrow.

00:40:21.209 --> 00:40:21.729
Thank you.

00:40:37.883 --> 00:40:38.770
(Yan Fei to Jiang Chen)

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:39.729
Mission accomplished.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.770
But you're not

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.370
on her thank-you list.

00:40:46.729 --> 00:40:47.528
Mr. Zhou.

00:40:54.209 --> 00:40:54.770
Mr. Zhou.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:56.970
Can you just tell me

00:40:58.529 --> 00:41:01.450
how the firm will handle this matter?

00:41:03.169 --> 00:41:03.784
Li Ke.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.049
Be honest with me.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.850
What happened?

00:41:11.729 --> 00:41:12.370
Mr. Zhou.

00:41:13.129 --> 00:41:14.450
I didn't do it. You know me.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:15.609
I'd never do that.

00:41:15.609 --> 00:41:16.209
It wasn't me.

00:41:16.209 --> 00:41:17.290
I don't know

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:18.169
how it disappeared.

00:41:18.169 --> 00:41:19.249
Calm down.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.450
This is indeed a serious matter.

00:41:22.249 --> 00:41:23.290
Original copies

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:25.129
must never be lost, regardless

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:26.529
of their significance.

00:41:27.089 --> 00:41:29.410
Or we lose the client's trust.
It's the bottom line.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:30.609
I understand, Mr. Zhou.

00:41:31.089 --> 00:41:32.729
But I finally got a win.

00:41:32.729 --> 00:41:34.089
I'd be in first place.

00:41:34.089 --> 00:41:35.290
I've never been number one.

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:36.649
It's my moment.

00:41:36.649 --> 00:41:37.890
Please help me, okay?

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:39.049
First,

00:41:39.049 --> 00:41:39.850
there's no evidence.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:40.410
Second,

00:41:40.529 --> 00:41:42.209
as your supervising lawyer,

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:43.609
I can't make any promises.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:52.490
I'm just scared that
if something happens,

00:41:53.529 --> 00:41:54.930
my sister will be disappointed.

00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:57.490
I don't want her to have any regrets.

00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:58.632
What about you?

00:42:01.129 --> 00:42:02.569
You don't want her to have regrets.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:04.089
What about you?

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:07.490
Is this your sister's dream or yours?

00:42:10.529 --> 00:42:11.609
Is there a difference?

00:42:12.729 --> 00:42:13.930
She told me to be a lawyer

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:16.089
when I was still in college.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:17.810
So joining a Red Circle Firm

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.330
became my sole ambition.

00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:21.370
Her dream is my dream.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.088
Alright.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:24.290
Then find a way to stay.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:27.569
Mr. Zhou.

00:42:28.649 --> 00:42:29.490
Do you trust me?

00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:33.850
I only trust facts.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:40.488
Li Ke.

00:42:42.249 --> 00:42:42.890
Lawyers meet

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:44.529
all kinds of people.

00:42:46.089 --> 00:42:47.209
No matter what,

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:49.569
the best thing we can offer them

00:42:49.729 --> 00:42:50.770
is never pity.

00:42:52.689 --> 00:42:54.010
We do our absolute best

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:54.729
to help them.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:56.770
I promised our mentor

00:42:57.249 --> 00:42:58.569
to look out for you.

00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:59.569
I want you to stay.

00:43:00.649 --> 00:43:01.490
But all I can say

00:43:02.529 --> 00:43:03.609
is find evidence

00:43:04.089 --> 00:43:05.810
to defend yourself.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:07.176
Understand?

00:43:13.689 --> 00:43:14.450
Understood.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.000
(What is
"Litigation to Drive Negotiation"?)

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.536
(It's a strategy where you
file a lawsuit or initiate arbitration)

00:43:18.536 --> 00:43:20.200
(to push the resolution
through negotiation.)

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.992
(The goal isn't to fight
to the bitter end,)

00:43:21.992 --> 00:43:23.560
(but to use legal action as a means of)

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.000
(applying pressure
and creating bargaining chips.)

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.664
(The ultimate aim
is to drive a more favorable)

00:43:26.664 --> 00:43:28.028
(and efficient negotiated settlement.)
