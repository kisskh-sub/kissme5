[Episode 22]

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.850
Alright, that's enough.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.380
Put it away.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.740
Lie down.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.210
Tuck yourself in.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.020
Okay.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.770
Go to sleep.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.660
Dad.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.290
What is it?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.690
Nothing.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.900
Good night.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.020
Okay.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.850
Sleep.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.850
Le, the noodles are ready.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.450
Thanks, Ms. Ming.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.450
Time flies.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.690
Le, you're already 12.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.170
I'm getting old.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.820
No, you're not.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.130
Grandma, you've aged well.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.820
When you were three, you had a fever.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.730
The doctor wanted to give you a shot,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.730
but you refused.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.060
Four nurses couldn't even hold you down.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.690
You were crying so hard.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.290
Your dad and I stood by the door.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.410
We couldn't bear to watch.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.890
After that,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.780
I took even better care of you.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.780
I was always worried you weren't okay.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.290
Your dad and I would argue about it.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.820
He said I spoiled you too much.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.260
It's okay, Grandma.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.820
I know you always want the best for me.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.170
You understand me the most, Le.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.410
Let me ask you something.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.540
Growing up,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.660
did you feel happy?

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.370
With you here, of course I'm happy.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.410
Even without a mom,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.140
you were still happy?

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.660
I think you've grown up.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.100
There are some things

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.220
you should know.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.660
You know, in this family,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.050
I don't like people mentioning your mom.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.580
Didn't my mom pass away?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.050
I'm sorry, Le.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.370
I lied to you.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.100
Your mom is still alive.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.900
Your dad told you

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.410
your mom was a ballet dancer.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.490
He showed me a photo of her once.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.370
It's the only thing

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.700
she left for your dad.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.780
So my mom is really alive?

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.410
Where is she?

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.580
Do you think that matters?

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.900
What matters is you.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.140
Le,

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.810
everyone

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.700
has a few

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.660
major decisions to make

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.730
in their life.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.900
But everyone

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.170
chooses differently.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.290
Some

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.460
choose family,

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.340
others choose their careers.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.850
Do you understand?

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.220
So

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.540
my mom didn't choose me, right?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.490
Le!

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.370
Get up. Breakfast is ready!

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.020
Le.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.020
Le?

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.220
Ms. Hu,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.050
is Feng Lexuan at school?

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.100
It's okay.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.340
Bye.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.140
Rui.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.700
Hey, Dad.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.140
Is Le with you?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.290
No.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.700
It's fine. I'll call Mom.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.140
Hey, Mom.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.700
Is Le with you?

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.980
Don't worry.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.810
I... I'll call you back.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.540
Siting,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.170
Le is missing.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.170
Okay. I'm on my way.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.930
Check all the surveillance cameras

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.810
on Le's usual route to school.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.170
And check with everyone
he's been in contact with recently,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.700
including his teachers and classmates.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.930
Ask them all.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.220
Got it, Ms. Gao.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.730
It must be because of me.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.940
He knows we're together,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.980
and he can't accept it.

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.730
Le has grown up.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.980
He must have his own thoughts.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.530
But he wouldn't do anything reckless.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.300
Any news from the school?

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:50.700
No.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.650
Excuse me,

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.370
has he been here today?

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.100
Sorry, I didn't notice.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.220
Thank you.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.060
What brings you here all of a sudden?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.060
Does your dad know you're here?

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.180
Let me guess,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.580
you had another fight with a classmate?

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.250
Ms. Wen,

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.730
how have you been lately?

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.770
I've been good.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.250
Just haven't seen you in a while.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.180
I missed you.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.820
Have you found someone you like?

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.060
Why are you asking me that?

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:17.420
My dad

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.300
is seeing someone again.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.180
Do you know who it is?

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:27.730
I know.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.300
You're not upset?

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.250
Actually,

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.300
when I first found out,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.940
I was a little unhappy.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.130
But

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.060
I gradually figured it out by myself.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.370
But that doesn't affect our friendship,

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:47.730
right?

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.300
Is that why

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.300
you came to see me?

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.890
Not really.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.300
I just don't really get Ms. Tan.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.340
At first, I thought she was really nice.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.700
We got along great.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.460
I started treating her
like one of my buddies

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.700
and told her everything.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.890
I thought she was so nice to me

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.180
because she liked me.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.980
But later

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.220
I found out

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.420
she started dating my dad.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.460
And she kept it from me.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.180
Do you think she got close to me

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.580
because she likes my dad?

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.530
I think you might be overthinking it.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.730
I think

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.250
Ms. Tan is not like that.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:38.850
I don't know.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.250
I think they must have their reasons

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.940
for not telling you.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.010
Maybe they were waiting
for the right time.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.770
But if you feel upset
and even skip school

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:51.980
because of it,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.460
that is really not right.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.580
You know

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.980
you're at a crucial stage right now.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.010
What if my mom didn't actually die?

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.580
What if she just didn't want me?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.300
What if she chose to

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.850
keep pursuing her ballet career
after having me,

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.490
and that's why she left my dad and me?

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.060
Why... Why would you think that?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.850
Who told you?

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.730
Grandma told me.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.940
I have never even met my mom.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.220
My dad rarely talks
about her in front of me.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.460
Maybe he is afraid it would make me sad.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.650
Once, he told me

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.340
that my mom loved me very, very much,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.370
but had no choice but to leave me.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:47.100
So I thought
that must mean she had died.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.130
I was afraid of making Grandma
and Dad sad,

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.100
so I never asked them about it.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.130
It is only now that I have learned

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.820
my mom did not die.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:01.220
She...

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.420
She just went abroad to dance ballet.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.460
She

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.460
left me

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.700
just to go abroad.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.770
I... Even though
she hasn't been there for me

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.340
all these years,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.370
I thought she must have loved me.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.820
Now I know

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.490
she never really wanted me.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.580
I really am the kid that everyone says

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.770
my mom didn't want.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.060
How could that be?

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.300
We all love you.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:44.700
Really.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.300
Every single one of us

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.180
loves you very much, you know?

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.250
Let me tell you something.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.420
You know the difference

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.820
between kids and adults?

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.890
If you like a certain food

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.340
or something,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.730
you can say it directly.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.980
But adults

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.820
often can't express themselves directly
for various reasons

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:11.130
or because they overthink things.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.250
So I think

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.300
your mom must have her own reasons.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.340
And regarding this matter,

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:18.770
I believe your dad

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.460
probably knows more than your grandma.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.420
So I suggest you

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.530
go home and have a good talk
with your dad.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.850
Tell him about your unhappiness

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.850
and your doubts.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.250
Maybe

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.370
it's not as bad as you think.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.060
Are you hungry?

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.010
Do you want something to eat?

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.370
Let me open it for you.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:55.250
Have one too.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.460
Me too? Okay.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.460
Let's eat together.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.370
Remember to unwrap it.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:09.700
Hello?

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.300
Okay.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.250
I'll be right there.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:16.980
What's wrong?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.700
Found Le.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.700
He's with Peiyan.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.580
It's okay.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:45.940
Le,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.770
what are you doing here?

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:52.940
Le,

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.770
you and Ms. Tan wait over there
for your dad.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.250
I need to talk to him
about something, alright?

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.700
Does Le know about you two?

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.060
It's all my fault.
I should've told him earlier.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.730
This has to be dealt with.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.890
You can't keep it from him forever.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.770
If he found out on his own,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.340
he'd just overthink it.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.420
We've been trying to figure out how.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.090
Has he been at his grandma's lately?

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.010
Yes. We just picked him up yesterday.

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:13.090
Sometimes

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.090
she says things without thinking,

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.010
and Le might take them the wrong way.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.090
So I think

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.770
you should really make time

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:20.700
to be with him lately.

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.980
Talk with him more.

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:25.220
It's important to keep him company

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:26.540
right now.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.020
I understand.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.620
You guys go ahead. I won't join.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.700
I need to go back to school.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.220
He needs you more right now.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:04.580
Okay.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.340
Mom, Le's been found.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.060
Don't worry. I'm bringing him home now.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.340
Did you miss Ms. Wen?

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.300
You can go see her.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.340
But next time, remember

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.780
to call me or your grandma.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:39.620
Alright?

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:41.860
Alright.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.460
We're skipping school today.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.140
I'm taking you somewhere.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:17.700
Want to give it a try?

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.180
Come on.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.180
Hit it once.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.460
Okay.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:25.700
Tighten up.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.740
If you loosen your grip,
you can get hurt.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.060
Yeah. Good.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.100
That's more like it.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.780
Good. Shoulders a bit further back.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:33.180
Okay.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.180
Yell. Let it out. Shout it out!

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.220
Whenever I'm in a bad mood,

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.340
I come here

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.620
to let all the unhappiness out.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.140
Then I feel much better.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:19.980
Do you feel a bit better?

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.620
Don't you want to say anything to me?

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:27.460
No.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.940
Don't you want to ask me

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.300
why I'm with Ms. Tan?

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:35.460
Dad,

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.180
like I said,

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.300
that's your business.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.140
As long as you're happy.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.100
Then

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:45.940
are you happy?

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.020
My unhappiness isn't because of you.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:04.540
Okay.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:04.860
Continue.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:08.740
Hold it tighter.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:09.620
Put more strength in your fists.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.340
Le,

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.300
you can't do this again,

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.100
understand?

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.380
I know, Grandma.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.940
My dad already talked to me about it.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.380
I know you're upset.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.340
If you

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.380
ever feel unhappy about anything,

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.580
just come and talk to me about it.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.260
Alright?

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:27.260
Okay.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.420
Grandma, I have homework to do.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.180
I gotta go.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:31.900
Okay. Go ahead.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:32.900
Bye.

Let's plan for another time.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.020
I have class
at the training center today.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.420
I'll see you there, right?

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.700
I learned a new piece today.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.740
Do you want to hear me play it?

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.180
How did I play?

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.780
Then I'll learn a new piece

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.220
and play it for you next time.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.620
I liked it. Thanks, Ms. Tan.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.140
Ms. Tan, let's have a meal together
this weekend.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.260
Great.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.020
I haven't had pizza in so long.
I'm craving it.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.500
How was Le last night?

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.780
Let's get
our French visas sorted this week.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:23.700
Get one for Le too.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:25.980
So sudden?

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.260
My mom must have said something

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:29.700
to Le.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.580
Le is mature for his age,

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.740
but he's still just a kid.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.460
He can't always tell what's true.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.780
And being caught between us

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.260
must have put some pressure on him.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.540
Maybe a change of environment

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.580
would be good for him.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.300
What about his schooling?

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.420
He just finished elementary school.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.780
Once the visas come through,

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.020
we'll find him a new school over there.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.740
I'll go to my mom's to get

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.580
the household register.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:07.940
I'll go handle it this afternoon.

Tiantian,

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.540
I wanted to ask,

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.460
how's that project I invested in
coming along?

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.140
Tiantian, look.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.380
If something's changed
with that project,

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:50.980
it's okay.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.140
Just tell me.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.900
Whatever problems come up,

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.860

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.180
to oppose us.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.940
But after all, she's my mom.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.020

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.100

It's okay.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.460
As long as I'm with you,

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.940

whether we go to Paris or not.

I'll stay by his side during this time.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.060

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.340

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:52.900
I think it's normal

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.500
that he can't accept it right away.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.620
He's a child, after all.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.780
Seeing you so worried about him,

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.500
I can really feel you becoming
more and more of a mother.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:09.460
Really?

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.500
When I learned that I had lost my child,

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.660
I thought I'd be alone
for the rest of my life.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.460
Coming back this time

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.420
and finding out Le is my son,

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.340
you have no idea how I felt...

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.380
I was so happy.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.100
And so nervous.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.540
I want to reclaim Le
as my son every moment.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.140
But my biggest worry
is that he won't accept me.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.180
I have faith in our child.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:01.820
Hello?

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:03.540
Ms. Wang, hello.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.580
I'm representing the bank
to notify you again

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.060
that you need to repay

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.340
the current bill and overdue interest
within two days.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.460
Otherwise, it will affect your credit.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:13.540
I know.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:30.900
Ms. Wang,

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.500
we've already completed the assessment.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.140
If you're selling them all together,

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.940
we can offer you around this amount.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.780
This price?

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.700
Can you reassess it for me?

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.180
A few of my bags

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.100
cost more than this before.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:47.460
Sorry.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.740
Maybe you should reconsider.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:49.740
Wait.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:52.620
No need.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:54.940

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.180

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:06.620
Done.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:07.860
And this necklace.

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:08.180
Okay.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:08.980
Alright.
