00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.850
Not bad.

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:03.955
Is this considered good?

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.690
It's okay.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.644
Let me warm up first.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.290
How is it?

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.340
Don't you always play recurve?

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.577
Why did you buy a compound bow?

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.690
I saw a video a few days ago

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.755
and thought compound bows
looked pretty cool too.

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:19.410
Don't you always use a compound bow?

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.488
Teach me when you have time.

00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:21.066
Sure.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.850
Try it first.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.660
Okay.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.100
Sister.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.410
How do I pull this bow?

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.780
Put the arrow

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.980
between these two yellow marks.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.500
Like this?

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.940
Don't point the black vane upward.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.800
Point it outward.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.850
The black one...

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.170
Right.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.060
Like this?

00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:53.088
Then pull like this?

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.010
Like this?

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.060
Here.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.380
This is...

00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:02.690
Your shoulders need to relax downward.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.780
And you need to learn to use

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.540
your back muscles.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.555
Use strength here.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.170
Back muscles.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.500
Yes.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.540
Watch again.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.890
Then, point your thumb at the target.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.170
Thumb at the target.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.540
Right.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.660
Like this?

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.220
Your hand should be flat here.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.010
In a straight line.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.060
Good.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.450
Your head...

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.100
Head...

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.660
Head...

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.170
Yes, your head. Don't tilt your head.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.060
Keep it straight.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.730
Don't tilt.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.340
Right.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.540
Okay.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:41.540
Let me try one.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.340
Impressive.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.220
How was it?

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.980
Not bad, right?

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:57.130
Then I'll practice over there.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.600
Your first time?

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.890
Pretty good skills.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.580
Nice.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.340
Mr. Lu, you're even better.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.900
Is this really your first time?

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.810
You're really good.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:02.460
Not too bad.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.340
I think you

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.666
could master it in one day.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.610
Hello.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.290
Okay.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.111
I'll come over now.

00:05:27.422 --> 00:05:28.377
What happened?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.580
Something went wrong on set.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.580
I need to go there.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.290
I'll take the bow back for you.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.490
No need.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.410
I can store it here.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.288
I live right across from you.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.577
Want me to drive you?

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.460
No need.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.044
It's just the industrial park nearby.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.460
I'll just grab a taxi.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.810
Okay.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.020
Thanks.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.111
I'm heading off then.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.100
Take care.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.660
Are you still playing?

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.660
I'm done.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.155
Alright, we'll call it a day then.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.022
Let's eat together sometime
when we both have time.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.850
I'm free today.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.610
Alright, then today it is.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.930
Jin, this one.

00:06:59.066 --> 00:07:00.020
This shot looks great.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.410
Yeah, I think this one is good, too.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.730
Jin, we really owe you today.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.810
This client

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.370
wanted to change the requirements now.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.490
If not for you,

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.780
we really couldn't convince him.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.340
Until the very last moment,

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.410
there'll always be changes.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.377
I'm already used to it.

00:07:13.422 --> 00:07:15.419
You have been on-site
these past couple of days.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.100
You must be tired.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.810
Go home first.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.100
I'll take care of the rest.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.730
Jin, you're too kind.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.711
All these years following you
really paid off.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.610
Thank you, Jin. We'll get going.

00:07:23.666 --> 00:07:24.511
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:07:24.555 --> 00:07:25.170
Bye-bye.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.580
Thank you.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.220
Tong, Chen Wei,

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.900
come help carry these things.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.460
Quick.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.930
Coming.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.600
- This one.
- Okay.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.170
This Osmanthus drink

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.290
is their signature.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:37.933
Your sister likes it.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:38.980
Try it.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.460
It's her taste.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.250
She likes

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.020
sweet and sour.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.020
The owner here is my friend.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.410
Whenever they introduce new dishes,

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.220
I call Cen Jin

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.220
to come try them with me.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.580
Your sister enjoys eating.

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.133
And she knows good food.

00:08:25.244 --> 00:08:26.000
Please enjoy.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.700
Okay, thank you.

00:08:28.177 --> 00:08:29.850
Their signature dish,
eggplant casserole.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:30.610
Try it.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.180
It's pretty good.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.580
What a pity.

00:08:48.822 --> 00:08:50.222
My sister doesn't like eggplant.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.100
Back then,

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.980
when we ate together,

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.100
I was always the one

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.755
eating the eggplant from her dishes.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:56.940
Really?

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.460
But every time we come,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.220
we order this dish.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.730
Your sister likes it a lot.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.610
You know,

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.460
people's tastes change.

00:09:15.444 --> 00:09:16.580
Theoretically speaking,

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:18.890
the human body's cells

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.100
renew completely every six
to seven years.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.220
So taste buds change, too.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.060
Even more so with preferences.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.610
Right?

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.820
This way.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:51.180
Excuse me,

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.580
what's going on inside?

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.250
We're currently

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.770
doing a fire safety self-check.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.422
(The Fire System Inspection Notice)
Notice

00:10:58.444 --> 00:10:59.600
was posted a few days ago.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:00.370
Didn't you see it?

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.530
I'm here today

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.420
only temporarily for work.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:08.530
Um...

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:09.890
My shoes are still inside.

00:11:09.911 --> 00:11:11.220
Can I go back and get them?

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:11.770
No, you can't.

00:11:12.022 --> 00:11:13.460
Wait until the inspection is done.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.420
I'll notify you, okay?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.130
Alright, thank you.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.850
Why are you here?

00:11:47.355 --> 00:11:49.377
It's too late. I thought
you might not get a ride.

00:11:49.622 --> 00:11:51.177
Why is there only one shoe left?

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.490
As I was about to leave,

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.060
the fire alarm suddenly went off.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.010
I ran, and one of my shoes came off.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.650
Who knew it was a false alarm?

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.250
They were just doing a fire check.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.580
You lost your shoes,
but not your laptop.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.250
Of course.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.222
This is our professional instinct
as Party B.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:16.940
Come on. Get on.

00:12:18.044 --> 00:12:19.177
What are you doing?

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.180
Carrying you home.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.820
My shoes are still inside.

00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:24.888
It took ages to get them via a reseller.

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:26.650
Today is the first time I wore them.

00:12:26.733 --> 00:12:28.355
I'd be heartbroken if I lost them.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.555
Now what are you doing?

00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:37.200
Waiting with you.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:42.490
Put your foot up.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:45.460
No need.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.220
Hurry.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:05.530
I'll take the flowers.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.620
Bye now.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.180
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.180
Thank you.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:09.620
Bye-bye.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.290
Head home.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:10.940
Okay, thank you.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.220
Li Wu.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:20.622
Did you grow taller again?

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.810
I have photos from back then.

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:29.660
Found it.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:31.220
Look.

00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.155
I'll send it to you.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:45.090
Wait a sec.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:52.900
Okay.

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:53.900
Sent.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.220
Compared to back then,

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:01.860
you were really young.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:08.330
Li Wu.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.420
Let's take a photo together.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:11.900
Sure.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:13.140
Wait a sec.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.066
Go stand there.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.620
Let's take a picture together

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.180
to mark this New Year

00:33:58.700 --> 00:33:59.810
as a new beginning.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.490
Okay, come on.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.210
Smile.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.460
Three, two, one.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.260
Huh?

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.690
Nothing showed up.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.010
It'll appear soon.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:44.820
Looks good.

00:34:49.644 --> 00:34:51.010
Alright, thank you, everyone.

00:34:51.066 --> 00:34:52.460
That's the end of my performance.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.260
I'm Handsome.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.720
Next, please welcome Mr. Yan Zhigao.
[*Means good-looking.]

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.090
Hello, everyone, I'm Yan Zhigao.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:04.740
Honestly,

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.780
I feel ashamed

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:06.820
of telling you this name.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.300
Because all of you look so good.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.740
I'm 30 this year.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:12.260
Could you tell?

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.700
(Monday I Don't Work)

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.170
Who couldn't tell?

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.530
I'm 30.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:17.260
Relax a bit.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.130
It's not class.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:19.780
Can you see it?

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.420
Never seen this before.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.860
This isn't a forehead line. It's a scar.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.210
Just laugh along. Don't think too much.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.555
When I was little, my mom bathed me,

00:35:25.555 --> 00:35:26.266
and I fell asleep.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.210
Accidentally hit the basin.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:31.380
So for my whole

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.530
thirty years of life,

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.650
I've been wondering
how people stay young.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:36.490
Anyone want to know?

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.130
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.420
I spent a year

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.090
figuring it out.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.170
Let me share it with you.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.888
This is what your ticket money is for.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.420
How to stay young?

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.980
The best way

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.740
is to hang out with young people.

00:35:49.088 --> 00:35:49.980
A few days ago, I asked,

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.055
"What do young people play nowadays?"
They told me something called, "Script Murder".

00:35:53.055 --> 00:35:53.650
Anyone played it?

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:55.420
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.420
I'd never played it. Didn't understand it.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.311
So I want to try it.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:35:59.860
Eighty yuan per person.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.090
I paid and went in.

00:36:01.222 --> 00:36:01.980
After entering,

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.300
they locked six of us in a room.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:04.820
No one guided us.

00:36:04.933 --> 00:36:06.610
Five minutes later,
someone came and said,

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.260
"There's a dead person in your room."

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.300
Scared me to death.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.210
I said, "I don't know!"

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:13.210
"I paid to be here!"

00:36:14.866 --> 00:36:16.260
"What's that got to do with me?"

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:17.570
He said,

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:18.940
"The killer is among you."

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:21.650
I said, "Then call the police!"

00:36:22.988 --> 00:36:24.780
Then he took out a notebook
and started reading.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.900
If you've never played, you wouldn't get it.
This thing takes a long time.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.640
You can't finish it without four
or five hours.

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.488
That day, we played
until basically midnight,

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:31.980
around the hour of Zi.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.210
I was starving.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.090
The key is, we didn't dare move.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:39.410
There was a dead body in the room.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.090
I said, "What are we gonna do?"

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:43.740
I said, "Let's order some takeout,

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.610
beer, fried skewers and crayfish.
A whole table of food."

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:47.900
We drank like crazy

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.949
until one guy put his arm
around me and said,

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:51.622
"Bro, stop looking. I killed him."

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.980
In a moment, whatever questions
you want to ask me,

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.340
just write them on a slip of paper.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.466
I don't need to prepare.
I'll answer you directly.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.533
Do you want to join in?

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.420
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:37:08.444 --> 00:37:10.444
Raise your hand if you want to join.
Let me see.

00:37:10.733 --> 00:37:12.200
Come. Pass out the pens and paper.

00:37:12.222 --> 00:37:12.800
Alright?

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:14.090
You can ask anything.

00:37:15.511 --> 00:37:17.622
After you finish writing,
give it to my staff.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.980
Anyone else with questions?

00:37:23.466 --> 00:37:25.380
After you finish writing,
give it to our staff.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:26.340
Thank you.

00:37:26.733 --> 00:37:28.622
"My little brother doesn't like
to smile.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.490
What should I do?"

00:37:30.733 --> 00:37:33.022
I want to know if this
"little brother" is here today?

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.170
Let's look for him.

00:37:35.266 --> 00:37:37.420
Who's the little brother?
Who's this? Lift your head.

00:37:37.844 --> 00:37:40.000
Actually, it's very simple
why he doesn't smile.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.690
Well... Why is it
that today he doesn't smile

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:43.740
or does he never smile?

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.210
Then just put him somewhere

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.210
really joyful.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.940
Mainly just not together with you.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.260

Happy twentieth birthday.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.860
Make a wish, and blow out the candles.

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.170
No need.

00:38:37.311 --> 00:38:38.490
What do you mean by "no need"?

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.690
You can only

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:40.940
make a birthday wish once a year.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.644
It's really effective.
You have to make one.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:45.860
Come on.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.066
What wish did you make?

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.050
Aren't we not supposed to say it?

00:39:08.022 --> 00:39:10.010
Haven't you never blown
birthday candles before?

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.570
Where'd you hear that?

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:25.980
I wished for everything
to be good for you.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.210
What kind of wish is that?

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:32.380
A birthday wish

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.460
should be for yourself.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:35.377
Make another one.

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:39.610
A wish for myself?

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:40.860
Yeah.

00:39:41.511 --> 00:39:42.650
Wish for what you want.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:45.380
What I want...

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.380
Li Wu.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.311
Do you believe in fate?

00:39:55.377 --> 00:39:56.170
Have you decided?

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:23.860
Sister.

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:27.130
Thank you.

00:40:28.777 --> 00:40:30.044
Again with the "thank you"?

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.940
Besides "thank you" and "sorry",

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.422
can't you say anything else?

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:47.940
I can.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.170
Then say it.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.380
You won't say this or that...

00:41:04.555 --> 00:41:05.800
Birthday present.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:10.740

Come.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.130
Only cut half.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:26.940
Like this.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:28.130
Right.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.900
Cut from the middle.

00:41:34.533 --> 00:41:35.210
Let me do it.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.420
