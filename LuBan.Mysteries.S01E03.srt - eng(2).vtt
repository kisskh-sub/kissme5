00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.439
See that?

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.120
The Qiao family is also a very grand household.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.480
Even if we go in through the back door,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.319
there are probably guards inside too.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.799
Who said we were using this way?

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:27.079
Which way then?

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:28.719
That way.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:30.680
The courtyard wall is so high.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.920
You two might get over it,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.319
but with my old arms and legs,

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.439
I cannot make it over.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.519
Then there is a second way.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.519
Where?

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:40.680
Have you heard that saying?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.319
A scholar can be killed, but not humiliated.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:43.159
All right, all right, then you...

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.879
Then take your time.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.200
We will go in first and wait for you.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.239
Come on.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.280
Hey, there is no guard here.

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:05.879
Have you ever heard a saying?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.680
A scholar can be killed, but not humiliated.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.639
I will never crawl through a dog hole.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.919
Have you heard another saying?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.080
It goes, a true man knows when to yield and when to assert himself.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:16.599
Hurry up.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.879
Do not go, give me a hand.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.280
Pull me, I am stuck.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.120
So much for knowing when to yield and assert yourself.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.800
Keep your voice down.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.800
Go, go, go, over there.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.680
Master, Furen is missing.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.680
Furen is missing.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.919
Was Furen not resting properly in her room?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.319
How did she suddenly disappear?

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.280
Tell the servants

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.199
to search the courtyard carefully.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.280
You hurry and prepare the young master’s Ghost marriage.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.960
We cannot have any mishaps this time.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.599
Do you hear me?

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:52.319
Yes, Master.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.240
Hurry.

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:55.199
Furen.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.560
Furen.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:58.800
This old man

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.439
this old man

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.759
is actually holding a Ghost marriage with a living person.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.759
We have to drag him into the station.

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:08.479
Right now,

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.159
there might be another bride

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.280
locked up somewhere.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.560
Here is what we do.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.800
We search inside the house.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.000
There must be more clues.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.000
Follow me, I know the way.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.960
Okay.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.680
Come.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.680
The coffin is prepared for the Ghost marriage bride.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.159
See?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.560
Tomorrow

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.840
the Ghost marriage must be held.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.599
Could the bride be inside?

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.080
What is it?

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.280
There seems to be something inside.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.800
There is something inside.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.920
That is odd, I just pushed it lightly and it opened.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.480
It opened just now,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.519
but now it will not budge.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.560
Then someone must have tampered with the coffin.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:44.279
Why is there a strange noise inside?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.519
Could it be him?

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.199
Tie them all up for me!

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.959
Let me go!

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.199
You there, Master Qiao—

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:55.399
I...

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.920
My dad is the bureau chief!

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.360
If he finds out you treated me like this,

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:00.160
you will be in serious trouble, I am warning you!

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:03.519
Your dad

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.639
never told you that breaking into a private home

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.000
is a crime that gets you punished?

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:11.399
Speak.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.480
Where did you take my wife?

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:15.160
Where have you hidden her?

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.800
We have never even seen Qiao Furen!

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.360
Ever since you people came to my house,

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.560
my wife has been missing.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.199
Looks like if I do not torture you,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.720
you will not confess.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.120
Come on then, bring the torture!

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.800
Master Qiao,

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.399
the government forbids private torture, it is illegal.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.720
Against the law.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.000
Then I will pry open your mouth first.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.319
Come, start with him.

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.199
No, no, no!

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.560
Master Qiao, I found Qiao Furen in the cabi—

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.000
in the chest and rescued her, I...

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.000
The government forbids ghost marriage with living people!

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:48.079
There is a living person in the coffin!

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.120
Hurry!

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:52.399
Master Qiao!

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.959
There is fresh blood flowing inside this coffin!

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.480
There is a living person in the coffin!

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.480
I am a carpenter!

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.680
Hurry up and untie me!

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.600
Saving a life is what matters now!

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:02.959
Untie me quickly!

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.879
Quick, untie him!

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.560
Come on, loosen these ropes!

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:05.399
Hurry, hurry!

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.040
Come on!

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.920
Everyone, give a hand, help out, hurry!

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:10.600
Come on, faster!

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:13.079
Open the coffin, come on!

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.279
One, two—

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:15.279
three!

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.000
One!

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.680
Two!

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.480
Three!

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:18.839
One, two—

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:19.959
Move aside!

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:29.399
Come on!

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:30.639
One, two—

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:31.519
Lift!

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.160
Qiao Furen!

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:44.720
My lady!

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.079
She must have been struck by some evil sorcery.

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.800
Master Qiao,

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.600
there is no such thing as evil sorcery in this world.

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:59.800
What killed your wife definitely was not sorcery.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:01.079
It should have been

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:04.360
a top carpenter skilled in the Art of Mechanisms.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.360
Could it be him?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.399
After him!

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:52.720
Officer Yang

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.240
Officer Yang

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.399
What is this

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:58.720
What is this thing

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.399
Third quarter of si hour, ruined temple north of town

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.560
If you are late, you miss your chance

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.240
Did the killer leave this

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.720
Are we going to go

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.680
Of course we are

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:10.680
Wai wait wait

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.839
If we are really going

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.639
Officer Yang is not here, it is just us two

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:15.560
Should we go back and call more people from the station

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:17.600
Fine, then go to the station and turn yourself in

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:19.439
Why would I confess, I am not the killer

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.879
Did you not say it yourself

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.040
The killer is a top level carpenter

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.920
So now, besides Yang Zong

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:24.160
who can clear you of suspicion

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:25.920
And there is no time to call in more officers

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.680
Let us go

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:31.360
Is this not the Yellow Immortal temple

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.399
Some people say

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.039
this place is haunted

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:37.679
Others say

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.480
every full moon

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:40.720
the Yellow Immortal

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.720
holds some kind of

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.000
banquet right here

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:45.679
Some even say

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:47.799
that right here

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.519
they have seen a Yellow Immortal as tall as a person

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.679
It is someone in a costume

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.039
People like that are either crazy

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.720
or fugitives who cannot show their faces

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.039
I do not know about fugitives

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:00.320
but catching fugitives

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:02.240
is your police work too, right

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.639
If this case gets solved

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.120
I will have my father give you a bonus

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:07.600
What bonus would I get

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.799
Young miss

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:28.320
Someone lives here

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.720
I knew it

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:31.879
All this haunting stuff must be man made

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.639
What puzzles me is

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.039
who lured us here

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:38.200
No idea

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:40.600
But the killer will definitely show up

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.480
Who

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.039
Just now, was not there three statues

00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:52.840
What was that sound, who is there

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.000
Who is it

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.679
Yuan Laoban

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.440
Lao Yuan

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:06.039
What are you doing here

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.879
It is the fifteenth again

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:09.399
Same old rules

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.639
I have to pay my respects

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.559
Wha what rules

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:13.919
People in his line of work

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.360
always find somewhere to pray on the first and fifteenth

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.720
Lao Yuan, tonight will not be peaceful

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.120
You had better hurry home

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.679
I can not

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:25.639
If I do not pray, I feel uneasy

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.480
The window

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.759
Darn it, we have walked into a trap

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.960
You mean we fell into Lao Yuan s trap

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.279
If I had known it would be like this

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:47.320
I would not have come

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.799
Stop pretending to be ghosts and gods

00:10:48.919 --> 00:10:50.320
If you have got guts come out and talk

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.360
Who, who is it

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.519
Go
