Careful.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.640
The weather is pleasant today,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.560
yet it feels
as though something is missing.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.080
Someday let us choose
a snowy night beneath the moon,

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.520
and watch the sky full of stars.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.800
That must be a hundred times
more beautiful than now.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.439
Your Highness.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.039
Do you like Official Li?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.520

Thank you, sir.

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.639
Now I finally understand

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:39.240
what the scholar was thinking.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.879
Yet,

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.280
the story of the scholar
and the Princess

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.439
seems unable to continue.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.560
The scholar and the Princess

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.000
can only part ways here.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.719
Why?

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:03.879
Love was real.

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:06.439
Resentment was real.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.639
The hurt was real.

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.039
So was the regret.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.970
After so many years of entanglement,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.480
causes and consequences

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.360
are no longer clear.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.160
Since that is so,

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.720
letting go might be better.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.120
As you once said, sir,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.959
not every story

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.720
needs an ending.

So it turns out,

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.800
a sky full of stars

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.319
is not as beautiful as I once thought.

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:02.600
Someday let us choose
a snowy night beneath the moon,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.120
and watch the sky full of stars.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.439
That must be a hundred times

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.160
Sir,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.560
from now on, I will not come to you
for stories anymore.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:20.120
These days,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.600
thank you.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.600
Between us,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.680
is this all there can be?

Li Yuanze.

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.879
Let us treat each other as strangers.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:47.920
And walk our separate ways.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.800

You still make things hard for yourself.

00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:00.720
No wonder your mentor asked me

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.000
to give this to you if we met.
