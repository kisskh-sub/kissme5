That's right.

Eat more.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.090
You won't get strong if you don't eat at night.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.180
Are you already capable enough to kill?

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.750
Shouldn't you kill me next?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.680
Mr. Chairman.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.050
No matter how bold I am,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.040
I wouldn't dare.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.540
You dare to kill a suspect,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.060
so what else do you dare not do?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.960
Mr. Chairman.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.470
If I were a steward,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.790
I wouldn't dare to do anything,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.470
but if I were a horse slave,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.150
I might dare to do anything.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.370
Is that a threat?

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.510
Please let me explain.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.920
My brother told me

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.320
that if a relationship

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.710
comes to a point

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.860
where one of us has to die,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.330
it's better if you do.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.640
This day didn't have to come so soon,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.430
but you forced me.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.470
I've

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.140
treated you well.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.380
Treated me well?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.080
How dare you say that?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.880
I can tolerate everything else,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.110
but if you make me live in poverty again,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.800
I can't tolerate it.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.110
Because I'm afraid of poverty.

Are you awake?

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.870
I can give you anything you want.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.520
Once you're dead, all you have will be mine.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.740

to watch yourself buried alive.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.840

You can't kill me.

You don't know the power behind me.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.870

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.360
who can become a horse slave at any time,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.240
so how dare I lie to you, Mr. Chairman?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.960
I see.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.520
Are you trying to clarify with him in front of me?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.670
Yes, Your Excellency.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.640

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.670

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.150
Okay, I have no objection.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.390
Let's get started.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.080
Chairman Li,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.120
did you order me

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.470
to set fire to Lin's Mansion?

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.790
Yes.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.680
What's wrong?

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:41.960
Why did you set fire to Lin's Mansion?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.690
Chairman Song died in Lin's Mansion,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.300
so wasn't it right for me to burn it down?

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.680
Your Excellency.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.280
You've heard it all.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.940
Please don't blame me for this.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.080
Your Excellency.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.140
As a Breakwall man,

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.080
what's wrong with me wanting

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.870
to catch that Breakwall traitor?

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.390
Good.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.960
Since Mr. Chairman told the truth,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.980
I'll also tell you my course of action that day.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.120
On that day, I went to burn Lin's Mansion as you said,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.790
but I was knocked out when I arrived.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.440
I don't remember what happened after I fainted,

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.830
but when I opened my eyes,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.760
I saw a man collapsed and dying

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.580
in front of me.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.030
He delivered the handkerchief and Xun to me.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.470
Your Excellency,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.230
you know all about the aftermath.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.030
Nonsense.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.830
It was you who killed the man.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.880
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.440
With your own eyes?

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.200
That's strange.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.320
Has Mr. Chairman been to Lin's Mansion too?

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.150
Or were you secretly following me

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.560
because you were worried

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.440
that I couldn't do the job?

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:47.520
Your Excellency.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.400
I did send someone to keep an eye on Lin's Mansion,

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.680
but believe me.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.590
Sun Siming must be the murderer

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.000
because he was already dead

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.910
when I went there.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.880
Just now, you said

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.230
you saw me kill him with your own eyes,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.270
but now...

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.880
I know you can

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.080
turn black and white upside down,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.200
so I said that

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.230
to prevent him from framing me.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.350
Your Excellency, the truth is

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.080
that when Master Lin appeared,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.960
I had fainted,

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.880
but the man sent by the chairman

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.880
was sober,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.960
so we don't know

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.440
whether Master Lin was killed

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.640
by the man he sent

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.200
or by Mr. Chairman himself,

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.560
but when I opened my eyes,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.390
what I saw was

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.230
that Master Lin was already dying.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.350
Mr. Chairman was going to kill me.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.440
Fortunately, Xichuan's Young Mistress

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.880
suddenly arrived,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.760
so I was saved from being killed.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.790
Xichuan's Young Mistress?

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.480
How can you prove it?

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.120
You can ask the Young Mistress yourself,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.390
and she can testify for me.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.960
Li Zhizhuo.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.710
What else do you have to say?

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.640
Your Excellency.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.270
Don't believe this fool's nonsense.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.540
He's a madman.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.880
If I was going back to My Lord,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.200
catching that traitor

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.800
would be the best credit I could have,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.420
so why would I kill him,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.140
Your Excellency?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.590
If you put it that way,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.030
it seems to make sense.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.960
Yes.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.760

However,

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.390
I don't believe it.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.910

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.350

I went to every morgue in Xichuan today

and searched through all the records for several years

It seems that Jia Xiaolong didn't lie,

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.630

get the Water-shaped Jade?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.750
He's been dead for so long,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.300
so there's no way to verify this.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.710
Han Shuo's ancestors were all tenants

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.990

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.710

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.470
That's not my fault.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.040
Jia Xiaolong and the others got hurt often.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.350
They spent a lot of money

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.080
on treatment and healing.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.300
Those people

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.680
were so poor

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.560
that they didn't have even a penny.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.870
We paid it all for them.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.800
Because I promised Jia Xiaolong

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.870
the Water-shaped Jade in exchange for their safety.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.470
I can't go back on my word, right?

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.590
So

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.750
you're using my clinic as a charity?

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.800
We're not.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:19.350
You guys.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.320
Find me the books of the clinic.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:26.630
Go make money for the clinic.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.960
Otherwise, sleep on the streets.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.230
How do we make money?

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.040
How should I know?

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.710
Thank you, Chairman.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.560
Thank you, Chairman.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.400
Thank you, Chairman.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:50.920
Can't you say something pleasant?

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:52.440
Let me do it for him.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.110
Congratulations to Chairman Sun on his appointment as Chairman

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.350
and his ability to do good deeds

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.470
on his own terms.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.550
Knowing it's a happy day,

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.120
I brought some gifts to the mine

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.330
to cheer up the poor pals,

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.640
but I didn't realize I'd alerted you.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.840
Steward Wang.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.510
Yes.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.470
Distribute all our gifts

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.790
to everyone.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.470
Okay.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:22.120
Thank you, Chairman.

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:23.680
Jiu.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.920
Show them the way.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.310
I used to starve every day

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.640
when I had no money,

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.120
so my brother and I went robbing with hunger.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.230
My brother offered

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.680
to buy flatbread with the money,

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.070
but I was afraid I'd be hungry the next day

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.270
after the day I'd eaten enough,

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.470
so I used the money to buy a shovel

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:55.840
and came to this mine.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.470
I thought if I could dig up

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.160
the Star Gold that belonged to me,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.030
I wouldn't have to starve any longer.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.310
I thought you should know

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.310
that Star Gold is hard to find.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:08.360
I know,

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.920
so I sharpened

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.120
my shovel,

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.960
crouched at the foot of the mine wall,

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:18.360
and listened for footsteps.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.230
The one whose footsteps were more rapid

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.960
than the others must have Star Gold,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.990
so

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.440
I waited,

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:29.880
kept waiting,

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.270
for someone

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.790
to bring out

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:35.270
my Star Gold,

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.120
but I waited for nothing.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.360
I passed out from hunger,

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.920
but looking back on it,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.200
I know I was lucky to have survived

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.650
because I didn't know

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.270
that the whole mine

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.120
was being watched by Jiu.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.960
If I had actually robbed it then,

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.880
I'm afraid I'd be dead.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.030
You were lucky.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.710
My luck was okay,

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.200
but my brother's luck wasn't.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.310
Finally, he couldn't stand the hunger,

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.960
so he stole food from Song Jingye.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.200
Siming.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.230
Siming.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.440
Siming.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.710
Siming.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.160
Where have you been?

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.270
Flatbread.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.120
Flatbread.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.680
Eat the flatbread.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.920
Have you eaten?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.470
Eat it.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.580
Do you want it?

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.550
Eat it.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.200
Eat it.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.070
Come on.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:28.840
Is it good?

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.640
What happened to your head?

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:34.510
Who did this to you?

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.200
Eat it.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.070
He got hit in the head with a stick

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.310
and became retarded.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:42.960
Now.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:43.840
Eat.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.400
Eat.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.920
Why am I telling you this?

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.310
But I've always felt

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.550
that a man can suffer

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.470
as much as

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.070
he will enjoy.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.270
If I hadn't lived through those days,

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.880
how could I

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.960
be talking to you today?

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.600
Right?

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.400
By the way,

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.200
this gong.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.440
Anyone who finds Star Gold

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.470
needs to hit the gong.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:15.960
I've been wondering

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.470
when I'd be able to hit this gong,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.200
but so far,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.360
I've never succeeded.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.880
Maybe it's not in my destiny

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.230
to hit the gong.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.960
I've always wanted to do it.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.710
Feels good!

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.230
Villains holding sway.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:19.800
Almost done?

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.930
You've eaten so much already.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.880
Have you got a conscience?

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.030
You've enjoyed yourselves,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.440
but I haven't had enough.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.640
All right.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.680
Have some more.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.270
Is it good?

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.790
It's a mixture of fat and lean meat,

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.160
and the purple perilla is good

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:38.440
for relieving the fat.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.030
All right, go ahead.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.640
Let me ask you about something while you eat.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.510
Actually, I think

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.510
Wen Jue was right.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.320
Our clinic has at least a few dozen people

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.960
registering and picking up medications every day,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.510
but I did the math and realized

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.070
that it couldn't make the balance zero,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.160
so whose pockets

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.990
did the money go into?

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.160
And who suffered the loss?

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.680
I have two younger brothers.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.370
Junior eats the most.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.640
[Hu's Flatbread Shop]
As an older brother, I couldn't

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.750
let them starve, so I asked the merchants back to Shangyi

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.030
to send them money a couple of times,

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.750
but I just took a little bit.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:23.200
Just a little bit.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.030
See?

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.510
They say

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.120
thieves from within

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.680
are the hardest to guard against.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.680
Don't speak so harshly.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.640
When I find the Treasure of the Sealed Book,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.640
I'll pay you back tenfold, no,

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.600
a hundredfold.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.640
Speaking of the treasure,

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.360
I never asked you.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.790
You're so obsessed with the treasure,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.470
so if you really find it,

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:51.440
what are your plans?

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.070
Give it to my brother, of course.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:55.710
I'm talking about you.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.120
What will you do?

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.230
Me?

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.200
After I settle my brothers,

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.990
I'll pursue the three necessities of my life.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.750
Tell me.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.600
What are the three necessities?

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:14.990
Wine,

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.120
meat,

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.510
and the world.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.310
Those are my three necessities.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.200
In all the time I've known you,

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:25.790
this is the first time you've told me

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.230
what you're going to do.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.470
That's good.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:29.440
What's the point?

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.680
We haven't found the treasure yet.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.920
I don't know when I'll be able

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.920
to live like this.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.160
Speaking of which, we've found two pieces of jade now.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.270
Still missing the last piece.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:39.990
What's next for you?

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.510
I have no idea.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.270
So many things have happened

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.680
since we came to Xichuan.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.120
They're pretty scary.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.010
Think about it.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.600
Anyone related to jade

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.270
is either dead or missing,

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.550
so I always feel like

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.500
there's someone behind it all.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.470
It gives me the creeps every time I think about it.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.920
Then let's stop

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.840
and go back to Shangyi.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:11.550
No for sure.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.550
Since we can't go back to Shangyi,

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.270
let's hurry.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.120
Whoever this person is,

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.550
if we're fast enough,

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.200
he or she won't catch us.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.990
Leader, Sun Siming is here.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.710
Go around and see if there are any ambushes.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.550
Yes, sir.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.710
Sun Siming.

What are you doing in my tent?

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.360
Celebrating.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:46.880
Celebrating?

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.470
Celebrate what?

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.640
Celebrating that I'm the Chairman of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.640
Anything to do with me?

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.120
Che.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.030
I'm sad to hear you say that.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.160
I've known you for a long time

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.550
and have been looking forward

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:07.840
to having a drink with you someday,

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.400
but I've never been in a position

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:11.790
to do so.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.710
Today, I became the Chairman,

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.880
so I rushed over to share the joy with you,

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.880
but you said it had nothing to do with you,

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.070
so how could I not be sad?

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.440
What are you doing here?

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.880
Can't I just come and visit?

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.470
I've come to be your guest

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.070
and welcome you

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.360
to the Jibei Chamber of Commerce

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:29.990
when you're free.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.600

the food,

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.600
and the wine.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.600
I've prepared everything for you.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:37.790
Cut the crap. Now

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920
let me feel

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.160
the flavor of Xiangshui Gang.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.120
Leader, there's no ambush outside.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.440
What now?

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.160
Okay, come on.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:54.600
Set the banquet.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.440
Yes, sir.

Who do you want to see?

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.760
I am Fu Sheng,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.240
a physician of Wenfu Hall.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.680
I've come to Mr. Luo to ask for something important.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.830
Are you here to apply for a job as a physician too?

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:23.000
Why didn't you come earlier?

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.920
Master has already met

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.920
a group of physicians in the afternoon

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.240
and is now taking a break.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.680
I was delayed

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.440
looking for a remedy

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:32.760
for Mr. Luo.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.760
Please excuse me.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.390
OK.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.870
[Luo's Mansion]

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:36.350
Come in with me.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.040
Thank you.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:43.820
[Luo's Mansion]

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.200
Mr. Luo, are you feeling a bloated abdomen,

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.480
loss of appetite,

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.670
and even blood in your stool lately?

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.390
Please speak frankly.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.760
Lumps in the abdomen

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.040
accumulate on the intestines.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.650
Lumps in the abdomen?

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.730
Then this is a serious illness.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.870
It seems that you are prepared

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.450
for this disease as well.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.810
Many physicians in the city

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:22.920
have informed me truthfully,

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.890
but they understand the disease

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.890
without the ability to cure it,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.740
so it remains incurable

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.340
to this day.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:34.090
Physician Fu.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.370
It seems that you were not prepared

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.160
for this disease,

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.590
so you did not

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.830
come here today

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.340
for my disease, did you?

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:45.830
Then I'll tell you the truth.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.480
I came to you today

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.000
to ask for something.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.550
Five years ago,

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.390
you had an errand boy

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.870
named Han Shuo.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.000
Do you still remember?

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.720
He has been dead for years.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.000
Physician Fu.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:08.350
Why are you asking about him?

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.790
I want to know

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:12.760
who he knew well

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.980
before he died

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.400
or what friends he had

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.030
or

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.990
who was in his family.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.070
Physician Fu,

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:25.470
my master is tired.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.600
Han Shuo's parents were also servants here.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.650
Their ancestors worked at Luo's Mansion.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.270
Han Shuo's father died young,

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.550
and he was orphaned.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.680
My master took pity on him

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.680
and took him in,

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:36.880
but he died

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.880
suddenly and unexpectedly.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.200
My master doesn't want

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.820
to talk about it.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.610
Physician Fu, please forgive him.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.680
Physician Fu.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.400
My master is physically ill.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.070
Can we talk about it next time?

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:53.770
Mr. Luo.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.210
I'm afraid

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.340
I'm the only one who can cure you.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.160
Really?

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.070
Of course.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.750
I came here

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.030
to ask about Han Shuo,

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:09.790
but when it comes to the sick,

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.840
as a physician, I must do my best.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.550
I don't mean to be secretive,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.360
but this is really a matter

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.680
of my best friend's secret

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.400
and even

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.550
the lives of his entire family.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.440
So don't you care about your own life?

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:29.990
Have you lived long enough?

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.150
If you

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.680
can really cure me,

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.050
I will tell you everything I know.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:46.440
Good.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.380
Then we have a deal,

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.050
but I need some time to prepare.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.630
I will let you know

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.830
when I am ready.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.440
Physician Fu, how do you heal?

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.040
My method of healing is

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.680
to cut open your stomach

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.440
to extract the accumulation.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.030
If it's accumulated in the intestines,

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.470
I'll need to cut, clean, and suture the intestines.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.330
Okay.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.850
Then,

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.440
thank you, Physician Fu.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.230
It's my job.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.470
myself to,

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.310

disappoint me.

more often if you want.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:48.400
You didn't disappoint me.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.640
Good friend.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.710
Should I kill him?

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.790
Send him back.

He got sick when I went there?

He was already sick.

to tell me about Han Shuo

if I cured him.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.990
From his words, I can tell

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.310
there must be something strange

This is so unsightly.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.710
Nonsense.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.600
Wen Jue.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.200
Take the rabbit. Let's go.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:54.360
If you think you can do it,

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.230
Come on.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.360
Come on.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.200
Do it right.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.030
You do it.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.440
So what even if I do?

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.320
Come on.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.510
I'll build you a new house.

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.990
Is the thread ready?

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.280
Yes, sir.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:27.800
I'm going to try the thread to see

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.110
if it's usable for sewing up intestines.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:29.880
Take notes.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.070
Don't worry.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.240
Fu Sheng.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.960
Don't worry. I'm just doing an experiment.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:39.670
It'll be fine.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.400
The blade isn't very good.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.840
The thread suture failed?

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.840
Quite successful, actually.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.550
Why did the rabbit die?

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.760
It was the knife's fault.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.170
This knife has an elaborate pattern,

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.670
but it's prone to harboring dirt.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.030
Surgery with this knife

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.990
can easily lead to pus in the wound.

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:32.400
I'll have to use a different set

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.510
of knives to cure him.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.280
More than that.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.030
We'll have to try more things

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.990
to know what's best.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:42.190
Right.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:44.780
Being wider might be too much,

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:46.840
but being narrower might not be enough.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.760
We have to get the right size for this.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.590
Why don't I try it for you first?

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.280
Stop.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:07.880
Stop.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.670
Stop.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.070
Stop.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:14.990
Really.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.030
Let me cut you. Just one cut.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.800
Why don't you experiment on Wood?

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.400
His skin is too hard.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.110
It's fine for internal experiments,

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.360
but it's not suitable

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:25.550
for anything else.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.510
Nonsense.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.640
Get down.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.920
Wood, you...

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.240
Let's talk this over. Don't be impulsive.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.360
What are you doing with all these knives?

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.670
Help!

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.590
Help!

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.110
These four knives are drawn

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.280
by my heart and soul,

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.360
so I'd like to try these knives

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:50.760
on you today to see

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:52.880
if they are good.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.180
Then explain to me what's the meaning

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.840
of the stir-fried duck meat,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.030
cold duck intestines,

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.110
deep-fried duck collarbone,

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.280
and braised duck head behind you.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.720
I'm imagining wildly again.

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.110
I need to forget about that.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.760
Let's test the knife first.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.440
Get away from me.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.360
Don't come any closer.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.110
Sir.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.670
How's my knife?

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:24.800
It's done.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:25.760
Just a minute.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:33.760
Come on.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.190
Try it.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.720
It's an elaborate knife.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.320
Good knife.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.960
It's a masterpiece.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.030
Thin as a cicada's wing.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.720
It would be a marvelous tool

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.440
for surgery.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:00.880
How was it?

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.360
Did it work?

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.590
It's

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.670
sharp

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.580
but not precise enough.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:10.920
Look.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.570
The strength

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.250
of the cuts varies,

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:17.190
and there are some tiny serrations here.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.510
If this knife were used for surgery,

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:21.800
it would hurt other tiny parts.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.590
Sir.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.110
Please make it a little finer.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:27.150
Young Mistress.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.410
I've done my best.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.240
These past few days,

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.280
I've really used all my special skills.

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:33.150
Physician Fu's demands are too high.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.440
I'm afraid there's only one person

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:35.590
in Xichuan who can

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.070
build this set of knives.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.590
You mean my father?

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.840
Your father can build weapons?

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.280
Physician Fu, you don't know

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.190
Lord Wen is the No. 1 craftsman in Xichuan.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.190
His craftsmanship is unrivaled so far.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.030
Okay. Leave it.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.550
I'll find a way to convince my father.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.510
Can you do that?

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.880
My father always listens to me.

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.840
If I want him to make iron,

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:58.880
how can he not agree?

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.510
[Lord's Mansion]

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:03.320
Father.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.320
Help me.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.070
Am I going to help you or him?

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.840
Isn't it the same thing?

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.110
Helping him is helping me.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.440
Besides,

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.280
Fu Sheng is your savior,

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.800
but is this how you treat him?

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:26.550
Won't you even grant him

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.720
such a small favor?

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.030
You're blackmailing me with favors.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.440
I'm old but not stupid.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.400
If I hadn't taken care of him

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.920
in Xichuan,

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:40.040
would he have survived this long?

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.800
Isn't that a favor?

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:43.880
Father.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.440
Think of it this way.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.960
In case you have any more illnesses,

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:52.190
you'll still have to turn to him.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.550
Father, just this time.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.230
I'm begging you.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.720
You're the best.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:07.660
That's enough.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.470
Can't you say something auspicious about your father?

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.920
So you agree?

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.840
You can show me your skill while I

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:14.630
can take this opportunity to learn.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.720
You want to learn this?

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:17.690
Why did you refuse to learn

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.990
when I asked you to before?

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.110
Father, you are the Lord of Xichuan.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.510
Breaking the rule once is not easy for you.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.190
After I learn it,

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:27.110
I can handle him.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:28.030
OK.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.720
I'll ask Jiu to get ready.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.880
You...

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.550
A grown girl can't be kept at home.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.800
That's true.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.440
You plotted against me before,

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.510
so it's your turn.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.990
I'm painless.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.320
Duck, take notes for me.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.920
I need to find the flow of human blood

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.400
before I operate on Luo Ye.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.550
Okay.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.280
Too deep?

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.630
You stabbed my spleen

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:14.720
and severed three adjacent blood vessels.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.960
The affected area is below it.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.110
What's wrong this time?

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.030
Two more vessels were severed.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.440
Can't you just hold on?

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.670
There are eleven blood veins

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.400
below the intestines,

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.440
five of which are main blood veins.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:50.110
I can't touch them while operating.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.760
Otherwise,

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.990
this bleeding

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:57.030
will kill him.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:58.960
I'm dead.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:02.720
I know.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:05.360

My Lord.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.680
I offered to go to Xichuan

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.320
to find the Bird Jade Plate for you.

but don't rush.

Wait a little longer.

My Lord.

Liu Yunting has been ineffective,

but you've honored her repeatedly,

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.280
so I'm not convinced.

You two are my right-hand women.

such a big salute?

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.470
My Lord.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.470
I have been in Xichuan for over a month.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.400
You sent me to look for the jade plate,

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.510
but I failed to get any news.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.840
This is my fault.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:37.190
I heard from Sishui

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.190
that you were amazing in Xichuan.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.030
Tell me.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.800
How amazing were you?

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.150
I'm too stupid

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:46.550
to know what you mean.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:47.590
Please inspire me.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.920
You ignored Li Zhizhuo,

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.990
whom we had nurtured for years,

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.400
and chose a lowly horse slave

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.960
named Sun Siming

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.840
to do your bidding.

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.950
What's even more ridiculous is

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.910
that you killed Li Zhizhuo

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.410
for him.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.240
How dare you?

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.400
My Lord.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:05.550
You have misunderstood me.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.990
Li Zhizhuo would not obey

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.240
or cooperate with me,

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.920
so I chose the obedient Sun Siming

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.670
to work for you.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.800
Does this man have some skills?

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:13.550
Yes.

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:16.770
He is ambitious, skillful, and obedient.

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:18.840
If he becomes the chairman of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce,

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.920
we will have a much smoother ride from here on out.

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:22.840
Yunting.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.030
You said that you

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.190
recommended Sun Siming as the Chairman

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.760
because he was obedient

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.440
and that you killed Li Zhizhuo

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:34.470
because he was disobedient.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:36.190
In that case,

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.190
if you are disobedient,

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:41.110
should I

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:43.510
kill you too?

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:44.590
Lord...

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.340

Sishui.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.150
Why are you still like that?

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:10.240
Whatever.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.110
You've earned your chance.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.320
Cherish it.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.880
Don't worry, My Lord.

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:19.150
I will find the Bird Jade Plate for you

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.990
on this trip to Xichuan.
