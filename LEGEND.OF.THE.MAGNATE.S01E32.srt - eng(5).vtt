[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.970
[Episode 32]

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.380
600 thousand dan?

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.360
Two or three hundred of...

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.420
Did you hear correctly?

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.680
It's absolutely true.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.210
It's 3.6 million dan.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.920
That much?

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.200
How could a small place like Nantong

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.330
possibly absorb it?

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.039
He originally planned

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.570
to transport it to Nanjing,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.039
but seeing Nantong hit by disaster,

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.680
he wants to sell part of it here

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.680
before moving on.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.780
Where's Li Million's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.840
good-for-nothing son?

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.070
He hasn't returned to Nanjing yet.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.000
But don't worry.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.870
We've posted men at every dock.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.169
As soon as he shows up,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.400
he won't get away.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.800
Look.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.120
This is the place.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.430
Sir,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.140
greetings.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.600
Who are you?

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.520
My surname is Yang,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.560
and I'm also a rice merchant.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.150
I heard you're here,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.290
so I came to pay my respects.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.880
May I ask your name?

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.460
My surname is Liao.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.640
Please sit down and let's talk.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.400
What brings you here?

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.680
You're such a big businessman.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680
Why don't you have a butler with you?

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.590
I'm not like those young fellows

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.360
who make little money

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.080
but put on a big show.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.750
I'm afraid they'll

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.270
steal my money,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.090
so I don't bring anyone with me.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.050
I keep my own books.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.030
Come on, sir,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.710
you...

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.870
Sir,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.560
I heard you brought

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.250
600,000 dan of rice this time.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.310
I'm also in the grain business.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.329
I'm a bit confused.

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.329
May I ask—

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.370
can you really sell

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.740
that much?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.800
I heard Nantong's coastal embankment
collapsed.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.680
The farmland was flooded with seawater,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.500
so it may take 2 or 3 years

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.260
before it can grow crops again.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.270
What's wrong?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.600
Can't sell it?

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.360
Hard to say.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.970
It depends on your price.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.540
You're fishing for my bottom line.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.310
No.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.420
If I know your pricing,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.520
I can work with it.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.710
We're on the same boat.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.630
Let's not

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.120
work against each other.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.080
Forget it.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.399
I've been asking around.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.310
The official price of rice in Nanjing

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.670
is 1.2 taels per dan,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.700
but common folks pay

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.270
1.8

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.250
or 1.9 taels.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.620
In Zhenjiang, the official price

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.610
is 1.5 taels.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.990
But the common folks

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.409
probably pay over 2 taels.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.530
Nantong is even crazier—

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.620
I heard it sells for 3 taels.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.700
If I don't sell my rice here,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.220
wouldn't I be a fool?

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.510
But haven't you heard?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.000
Rice won't sell at 3 taels anymore.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.080
I'm actually thinking about

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.230
lowering the price.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.320
This is where you fall short of me.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.120
Anhui had a good harvest this year.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.310
I plan to drive my rice price down.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.420
The price will be...

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.860
1.2 taels.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.310
Anyway, I still have

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.140
3 million dan of rice

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.260
waiting to be shipped here.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.880
This breaks the rules.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.920
Your rules

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.540
or my rules?

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.470
Your rice is from Anhui.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.080
If you drop the price by 0.9 taels,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.410
you won't make a profit.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.320
Along the way, there are expenses for food

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.470
for people and horses, road taxes,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.610
and tolls—

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.920
all extra costs.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.060
At 1.2 taels per dan,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.340
you won't even cover costs.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.190
I have a large quantity of rice.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.590
That's not the point!

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.240
Calm down.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.460
Sit down, sit down.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.010
Think about it.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.940
You sell at 3 taels,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.170
and I sell at 1.2 taels.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.450
Can you still stay in business?

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.630
You can't.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.420
Then the business here will belong to me.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.280
Once you leave,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.909
I can sell at 3 taels,

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.220
maybe even 4 taels.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.510
The imperial court
is about to start a big project here.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.110
I'll ship all 3 million dan of rice

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.170
over here.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.120
I can

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.570
make money later.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.340
You are a rich man with a big business.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.380
There's no need to compete

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.850
with an old man like me
in this small county.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.310
I'm begging you.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.420
I know a rice merchant from Anhui,

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.920
surname Sun.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.220
He's been active in Wuhu for years.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.720
Do you know him?

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.320
No, I don't.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.900
He's currently in Nantong.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.500
I consulted with him before coming here.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.450
He told me

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.110
he knows all Anhui rice merchants

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.000
with business

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.580
over a million dan of rice,

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.909
but he doesn't know you.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.530
I don't know him either.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.950
I used to be in the tea trade.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.000
That business failed,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.600
so I invested my retirement money in rice.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.800
If you know those

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.250
Anhui businessmen,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.360
you can

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.720
ask them about

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.870
Mr. Liao from Huizhou.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.350
That way,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.120
you'd know my background.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.190
How dare I

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.740
look into your background?

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.090
We were just chatting.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:37.700
A single straight purple bamboo.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.070
Come on, everyone.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.270
Mr. Li, you are such an

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.140
elegant, talented,

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.270
and promising young man.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.159
Yes, yes, yes.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.760
Good wine.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.360
Everyone.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.360
In Nantong,

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.740
rice is extremely expensive now.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.190
And if you want beauties

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.750
in Jiangnan,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.490
you just need to bring
a little extra rice.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.270
Mr. Li Qin,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.800
are the women in Jiangnan

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.330
really as pretty as you say?

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.360
Of course.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.310
You haven't been

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.550
to Nantong yet.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.520
As the saying goes,

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.980
"When Hunan and Hubei harvest,
the whole country is fed."

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.450
I'm here this time

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.950
to buy rice on His Excellency's orders.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.110
You just need

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.620
to ship the rice to Nantong.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.800
I'm using it

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.059
for the coastal embankment project.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:33.720
Before...

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.960
I have to make myself clear with you

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.370
before I get drunk.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.360
Otherwise, in a while,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.960
I'll definitely forget it.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.440
Mr. Li,

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.620
have another drink.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.670
One more! Come on!

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.750
Here, here!

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.840
Here, Mr. Li.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.480
Here!

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.510
-You really can hold your liquor.
-Great.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.240
Impressive!

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.720
Hold him up!

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.870
I'm fine.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.470
Brothers,

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.080

Have you ever seen a sage who was poor?

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.470
Nonsense.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.380
If you were poor,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.320
who would respect you?

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:12.590
Thank you

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.270
for the money.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.150
I was just eliminating threats
for the people.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.680
There's no need to thank me.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:21.670
Here.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.560
I have a little something for you.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.090
What is this?

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.060
A painting?

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.440
Mr. Gu,

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.280
I consider you one of my own.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.240
How can you not show respect?

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.640
Sir,

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.080
you're a senior
in the imperial examinations,

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.340
a first-rank viceroy,

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.280
practically half a sage.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.160
And I'm

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.400
just a small merchant.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.040
How would I dare call myself your equal?

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:57.780
Don't put on

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.970
that merchant's facade in front of me.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:01.430
When I first saw you,

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:02.590
I told Jiu,

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.230
"Is this a merchant?"

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.400
"He's a born scholar."

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:08.700
Jiu told me about you

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.910
and wanted to transfer you
under my command.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.920
At first I had my doubts.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.080
You,

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.270
your intelligence is too obvious.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.000
Luckily, you have a kind heart.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:19.430
Otherwise, who knows

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.000
how many times
you would have died already.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.710
This is a letter

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.190
I specifically submitted

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:29.190
in my name,

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:30.800
recommending you.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:35.470
I noticed that this man handles matters
with both tact and firmness.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.030
He's unassuming in appearance
but with the heart of a hero.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:38.990
He claims

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.990
to have suffered from madness
in childhood,

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.430
which flared up later
during the imperial examination.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.020
For causing a disturbance
in the examination hall,

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.470
he was sentenced to exile at Ningguta.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.230
I am willing to vouch for him.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.780
He can be officially conferred
the title of Associate Jinshi.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.320
To preserve
such a pillar for the imperial court

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.560
and such a talent for the southeast

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.940
is my great pleasure.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.930
I dare not accept such praise.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:08.600
"Handles matters
with both tact and firmness."

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.710
"He's unassuming in appearance
but with the heart of a hero."

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.770
In all my years of evaluating people,

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.930
only you

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.070
deserve these words.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.720
This is a letter

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:22.990
from the Ministry of Rites.

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.660
[Gu Pingyuan, from Jianshan County
in Huizhou Prefecture]

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.720
Go back

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.750
and prepare a record
of your ancestors for 3 generations.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.950
I will submit the memorial first thing
tomorrow morning.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.670
Does this small token of gratitude

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:34.120
meet with your approval?

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:42.970
Mr. Gu.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.690
Mr. Gu!

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.970
Are you stunned?

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.880
To wash away a lifetime of shame

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.800
is like being reborn.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.010
Indeed.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.410
How could a hero
remain in obscurity for long?

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.260
I am satisfied
with having handled this matter.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:16.320
Today,

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.740
don't go back to Nantong.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.450
Spend time with your family,

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.190
get the 3 generations' record ready,

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.250
and bring them first thing tomorrow.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.320
Yes.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.950
Sir,

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.840
there's another troublesome matter.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.860
When I was a kid,
my father went to the capital

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.230
to take the imperial examination

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:31.710
and has been missing ever since.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.910
I don't know whether he is alive or dead.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.160
I've actually

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.190
heard Sixth Prince mention this.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.580
The year your father went
to take the imperial examination,

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.320
there was a major epidemic in the capital,

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.520
and many people died.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.950
The Nine Gates Infantry Commander
at the time

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.340
had all the bodies burned,

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.090
so there's no way to verify.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:50.450
Just write it that way.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.920
Sir.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.920
I want to sincerely kowtow to you

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:01.010
on my father's behalf.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.600
So all this time

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.190
you weren't really sincere
in your kowtows,

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.840
were you?

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.900
Most of the time, no.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:14.000
This time,

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.719
being able to bring honor to 3 generations

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:18.590
and earn him an official rank,

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:21.800
I'm even happier
than if I received it myself.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.630
Of course.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.320
With an official rank,

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.850
even in the afterlife,

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.260
it's still an honor.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:28.280
Also,

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:29.840
it wasn't easy for your mother

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.929
to raise you from childhood.

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:33.400
Once you achieve merit,

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.820
I'll submit a memorial for you

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.820
so the imperial court
can grant her an honorary title.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.620
I thank you on behalf of my mother.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.679
I'll go back now

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:42.429
and tell her about this.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:43.469
Okay.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.760
By the way, Sir,

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:51.770
there's one more thing

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.239
I hope you'll allow.

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:55.880
Li Qin and I are brothers after all.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.430
Li Wantang is Li Wantang,

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:58.550
and he is himself.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.320
He made great contributions
to the coastal embankment project

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.030
and the reduction
of the rice price this time.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.720
He wants to earn the operating rights

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.800
of the Lianghuai region's salt industry

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.820
only because he made a bet

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.750
with his family,

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.480
wanting to become independent from them.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.150
I hope you can see this clearly.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.880
How about you

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.760
let him handle the salt fields?

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.990
I have a reason

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.100
for not giving him the salt lands.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.030
Last time you went
to negotiate with the Westerners,

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.040
they refused to budge even a little.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.530
They want to get into tea

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.610
and silk business—

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.950
anything that makes money,

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:34.480
they want their hands on it.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.600
If we really

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.690
give all the salt fields to Li Wantang

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.150
and he sells them to the Westerner,

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.150
what should we do?

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.360
Can I stop him?

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.490
What if the Westerners
jack up the salt price

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.590
and the people
of the Seven Provinces of Jiangnan

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.510
revolt?

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.760
Can you take responsibility for that?

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.250
I didn't consider that.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:55.950
I was short-sighted.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.290
I'll request credit for him

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.570
for the coastal embankment project.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:03.920
He can have some of the salt fields,

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.430
but the imperial court must keep some too.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.870
And frankly,

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:09.400
those salt fields he has

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.110
were taken

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:11.480
by exploiting the chaos

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.200
during the war in the south.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.880

your intelligence is too obvious.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.430
Trouble will find you in the future.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:28.670
You spared him today,

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.550
but in the future, he might not

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.150
show you the same mercy.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.150
You may go.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.680
Yes.

What happened?

My eyes

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.890
are failing me completely.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.950
Mr. Chang, please read it to me.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.680

from Shanjian Village, Huizhou Prefecture.

In the third year of Xianfeng,

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.240
he placed third in the county-level exam

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.650
in Shanjian County, Huizhou Prefecture.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.360
In the fifth year of Xianfeng,

he ranked first
in the Huizhou provincial exam.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.160
Is this for real?

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.880
Heaven has smiled upon us?

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.400
Heaven has smiled upon us!

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:41.920
Old Madam Gu,

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.030
Pingyuan has finally achieved success.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.760
He has a prestigious title now.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.470
Congratulations!

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.840
Mother,

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.920
the Viceroy of Liangjiang
recommended Pingyuan,

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.680
granting him

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.410
the title of Associate Jinshi.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.550
My son has left behind his lowly status?

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.280
Indeed.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.080
Prostitutes, actors, musicians,

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.480
and major criminals of the imperial court

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.800
are barred from taking the
imperial examinations for 3 generations.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.910
Now it's perfect.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.020
Your grandson

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.550
and his descendants

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.200
will have

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.660
a bright future.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.030
Where's our hero?

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:21.920
[Gentle Breeze & Bright Moon]

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.050
Don't call him that.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.130
Pingyuan is now an Associate Jinshi.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.150
Jinshis

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.330
are like stars descended from heaven.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:29.550
He doesn't have time

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.680
to chat with us about trivial matters.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.980
Indeed, Father.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.010
And stop calling him

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:36.160
Mr. Chang anymore.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.330
He's now

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.950
the father-in-law of an Associate Jinshi.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.960
We should call him Master Chang.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.840
Master Chang.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:46.630
Stop putting on airs.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.830
Your son-in-law

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.800
won't mind your humble origins?

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.020
You should go ask around.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.550
Will the daughter
of the Viceroy of Liangjiang

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:55.760
marry him?

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:57.990
Indeed.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.360
Anything could happen.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:03.190
He doesn't have a daughter to marry him.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.360
That's so improper.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.150
Why do I remember that he has one?

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.720
Mother,

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.920
let's go inside.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.880
He does?

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:11.040
Yes.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.300
[Half a City]

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.800
Careful. Be more careful.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.400
It's Emperor Jiaqing's calligraphy.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.260
Damaging even a bit of lacquer
is a serious offense.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.030
Every time I see this plaque,

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.830
I always think

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.300
it's only natural that

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.590
I've accomplished nothing in my life.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:32.790
Look, your ancestors

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.030
[Half a City]

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.030
were already so prestigious
a hundred or so years ago.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.230
Truly incomparable.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.690
This belongs to my wife's ancestors.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:41.430
Back then their holdings

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:42.320
were barely half a city.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.780
But in your hands, Master—

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:44.590
my goodness—

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.430
the business is nearly half a country now.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:47.450
The current emperor

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:49.110
should write you a new plaque.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:50.630
Write me a plaque?

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.990
Such little gain for so much effort.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.470
You may go.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:58.840
Master, look.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:39:59.920
These are all the guests who,

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.070
knowing we're reopening Li's Draft Bank

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.440
in Nanjing,

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.800
want to pay us a visit.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.650
Which one should we see first?

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:07.550
Let's see them one by one.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.590
It's customary for visitors
to pay respects to residents.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:11.630
Let's start
with the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:12.950
I've already arranged it for you.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:13.920
His Excellency said

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.840
he'll send his sedan chair tomorrow

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.990
with 6 imperial guards

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.150
to invite you to his residence.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.280
Even the 6 guards

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.580
wear official's hats.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:21.320
In the entire Liangjiang region,

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.780
no one else has such honor.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.110
It's merely a formality.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.070
Do you think
I dare ride in his sedan chair?

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.990
If an imperial censor sees me
and reports it to the court,

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.250
it would be a disaster.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.760
That old fox.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.720
He is holding on to the salt fields

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.720
and won't let me lay my hands on them.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:39.030
Master,

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.360
didn't you give this matter

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.110
to Young Master to handle?

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:44.370
Why not have him stand up?

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:46.280
[Everything as Wished]

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.100
He's been kneeling since early morning.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:59.420
[Grand Vision for Long-Lasting Prosperity]

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.360
[Everything as Wished]

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:01.950
Come on.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.440
Directly appointing a jinshi
to serve as a local official?

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.110
This is called the "Tiger List?"

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:08.950
At the very least,
you would be a county magistrate.

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:10.430
Being a county magistrate is not bad.

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:11.510
A county magistrate

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.550
is the parent official of a whole county.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.450
That's a lot of power.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:18.830
You lowly commoner.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.590
You're not convinced, are you?

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.400
The magistrate is holding court!

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.430
I'll stand aside.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.260
It's a good thing

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.820
you're not the one becoming an official.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:28.530
If you were,

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:31.080
the world wouldn't be big enough
for your ego.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.600
Pingyuan,

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.370
I'm just happy for you.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.770
I just can't stand

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:36.300
seeing you frown like that.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:37.710
I'm telling you,

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:38.510
sometimes,

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.070
people just can't
help making things hard...

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:40.920
for themselves.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.380
Who are you talking about?

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.990
Who are you talking about?

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:45.030
Get out!

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:51.240
Mother.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:52.710
Mr. Chang.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:53.680
Mr. Liao.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:55.160
Son-in-law.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.440
My Lord.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.730
Your mother deserves your bow,

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.680
but the two of us don't now.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.560
That's right.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:03.670
Mr. Chang—

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.320
No, no.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.780
Master Chang said

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:08.030
you've finally made something of yourself.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.320
If you ask me,

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:10.070
kid,

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.280
you've built great virtue

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.240
by fixing that coastal embankment.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.030
At noon,

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:17.360
we should have a proper lunch, right?

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.510
Mother,

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:20.800
I...

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.250
You're afraid you can't handle it?

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.240
A little bit.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.590
Come.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.990
Come with me.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.960
Let's have lunch together.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.950
Come.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.210
It's fine.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.110
You may go.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.530
Have you figured it out?

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.840
Not at all.
