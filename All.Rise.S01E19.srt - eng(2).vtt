There's a meeting soon?

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.780
Mr. Zhuang's.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.141
You need this room?

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.381
No, no.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.060
How's your injury?

00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:17.620
It's healed up.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.861
I came to bribe you.

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:23.261
Hey, watch your conduct.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.940
Seems like someone's skating

00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:27.141
close to the legal edge.

00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:28.981
You're being partial.

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.541
You took Li Ke's coffee.

00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:32.220
But mine? Suddenly, it's inappropriate?

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.900
Why's that?

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:35.821
I saw you

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:37.261
eating at lunch with Li Ke today.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.940
Help your junior out and help me too?

00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:42.900
Both Li Ke and Ren Jiatong
are on probation.

00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:45.141
Someone's got to cover
Ms. Bai's workload.

00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:46.981
Could I be the one?

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.180
Thank you.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.381
Call it opportunistic if you want.

00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:57.261
Or say I'm just hustling
for opportunities.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.740
I don't really care
about others' opinions.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.861
I just want this chance.

00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:07.940
I'll take this.

00:03:08.301 --> 00:03:08.904
Appreciate it.

00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:11.261
But to be fair,

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:12.821
I can't help you.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.821
Though I won't stop you

00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:20.701
from emailing Ms. Bai

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.101
to fight for that shot, right?

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.381
Thank you.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.101
Understood.

00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:41.101
How's Ren Jiatong?

00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:44.101
She was already asleep when I got back.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.301
Let her get some rest.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.180
She's tired.

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:49.421
I came for you, not her.

00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:50.701
For me?

00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:57.660
I just got off the phone with Li Ke.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.660
He's not in great shape.

00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:01.180
I ran into him earlier.

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.620
He smiled and said he was fine.

00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:05.141
But I could see

00:04:05.301 --> 00:04:06.541
he was really hurting inside.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.660
This is about their future here.

00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:11.740
Nobody would take this lightly.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.660
So what do we do?

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.220
Help them find evidence.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.941
"Help them"?

00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:25.660
Hesitant?

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.701
To be honest,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.448
yeah, I am.

00:04:34.701 --> 00:04:37.021
I've been at the bottom this round.

00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:40.581
I-I genuinely worry for them.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.941
I see how upset they are.

00:04:41.941 --> 00:04:43.501
Their pain weighs on me too.

00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:45.621
But...

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.501
I can't help thinking,

00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:48.821
what if this is my lucky break?

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.701
The thought crosses my mind.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.340
Just maybe...

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.660
if one of them leaves,

00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:00.900
could I make the cut then?

00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:04.821
It is brave

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.780
for you

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.100
to confess that.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.340
No matter how close we are,

00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.821
this is still a competition.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.141
Some win, some lose.

00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:18.581
I've had similar thoughts myself.

00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:20.100
I'm not brave enough to admit it.

00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:21.576
It's fine.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.860
Any inclination?

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.340
Want Ren Jiatong or Li Ke to stay?

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.980
No inclination.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.501
No preset expectations either.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.220
See, in the legal profession,

00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:36.420
ambiguity is the worst.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.821
So I won't accept anyone leaving

00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:40.860
without clear justification.

00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:43.141
Helping them is the least I can do.

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.100
Besides,

00:05:49.821 --> 00:05:51.660
we should be responsible
for our clients.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.181
Remember the Warm Nest case?

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.061
I was so principled

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.340
and wouldn't apologize.

00:05:58.261 --> 00:05:59.501
But then it hit me.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.220
Who else do we serve but our clients?

00:06:06.701 --> 00:06:07.304
Let's go.

00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:09.061
Back to the firm to find the truth.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.941
Let me ask my boyfriend for help.

00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:13.741
Are you back with Zhubao?

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.381
I've only ever had one boyfriend,

00:06:17.821 --> 00:06:19.381
Holmes.

00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:20.008
AKA...

00:06:20.821 --> 00:06:21.416
Sherlock.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.021
So Ren Jiatong thought

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:28.980
she shredded the original document?

00:06:31.621 --> 00:06:32.821
I think we should reconstruct

00:06:32.821 --> 00:06:33.501
the scene first.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.381
At that moment,

00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:38.900
this evidence box was on this side
of the surveillance blind spot.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.381
Ren Jiatong was standing
right here at the time.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.581
Li Ke was here,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.660
sorting through

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.980
the papers he was about to shred.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.021
Between him and the evidence box

00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:48.021
was Ren Jiatong.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.021
Logically,

00:06:49.021 --> 00:06:50.141
he couldn't easily

00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:51.300
grab the original document.

00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:53.860
But if Ren Jiatong
was here, she'd be farthest

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.941
from the shredder.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.136
Right?

00:06:56.296 --> 00:06:56.860
Yes.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.540
But if Li Ke wanted
the original document,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.141
he'd need to go

00:06:59.381 --> 00:06:59.941
to the back.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.021
Correct.

00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:02.780
So based on this explanation,

00:07:03.061 --> 00:07:05.141
one person was close
to the box, easy to grab.

00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:07.460
The other, near the shredder,
simple to destroy.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.540
But positions alone
don't prove anything.

00:07:11.141 --> 00:07:13.141
We don't know what else happened

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:14.381
in this blind spot.

00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:16.100
Also,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.581
was the original document in there?

00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:27.660
I can brainstorm with you.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.261
After all, I was there.

00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:33.660
I want to find evidence
to clear my name.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.104
Okay?

00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:41.660
I'll stand where Ren Jiatong was.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.860
You stand where you were.

00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:43.701
- OK.
- Jiang Chen, observe.

00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:44.780
Got it.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.061
Anyway, Ren Jiatong was

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.741
getting the photocopied documents

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.900
ready for binding.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.300
Meanwhile, I was dealing
with these waste files.

00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:56.980
Where was the original document
she was binding?

00:07:57.181 --> 00:07:58.021
To her right side.

00:07:58.941 --> 00:07:59.860
All our documents

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.780
were put together.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.381
New and old.

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:02.501
All put together?

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.821
Is it possible

00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:05.300
that the two documents got mixed up

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.381
and then discarded?

00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:07.261
I don't think so.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.100
Because we were

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.701
organized with the arrangement.

00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:13.340
I'll keep going.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.821
What if the document...?

00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:18.181
It scared me.

00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:19.381
Luckily, it's not open yet.

00:08:23.112 --> 00:08:23.624

(Letter Regarding Demanding
Share Repurchase)

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.940
What if...

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.861
this document and...

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.232
Li Ke.

00:08:40.381 --> 00:08:40.900
And then?

00:09:01.404 --> 00:09:08.968
(Letter Regarding Demanding
Share Repurchase)

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.420
Then probably,

00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:32.540
everything was placed roughly here.

00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:37.820
As for the rest, I...

00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:40.101
don't remember clearly.

00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:41.420
Maybe you can help recall.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.168
I...

00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:46.381
I'm unwell. I need to use the restroom.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.520
Sis.

00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:10.780
I think I messed up.

00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:13.900
I...

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.461
promised you I'd stay till the end.

00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:18.940
But I'm exhausted now.

00:10:20.741 --> 00:10:22.300
I can't hold on much longer.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.341
What should I do?

00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:44.232
Come in.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.621
Ms. Bai.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.580
Jiang Chen and Guo Xiaoyu
came to me earlier.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.580
They reenacted

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.900
their theory about how the letter

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.021
went missing.

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:56.341
I think

00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:57.981
I need to report this situation to you.

00:10:59.101 --> 00:10:59.861
Li Ke just left

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.621
my office five minutes ago.

00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:03.780
Li Ke? What did he say?

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.240
Ms. Bai.

00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:09.221
What I just told you

00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:11.060
is exactly what happened.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:12.700
I think

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.540
I need to take responsibility for this.

00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:19.780
Please sit.

00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:23.272
Sit down.

00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:30.021
Li Ke.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.700
I suggest

00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:35.180
you wait until the review meeting.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.981
Ms. Bai, I know you're worried

00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:40.180
that I'll regret it.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.900
But before coming to your office,

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.300
I've thought for a long time.

00:11:47.021 --> 00:11:47.820
I was afraid.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.741
Telling the truth

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.101
really requires courage.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.660
I'm not that selfless.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.180
But I...

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.461
I just got a call from my sister.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.700
All along,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:03.981
I thought getting

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:04.900
Jun An's offer

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.580
was my sister's greatest wish.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.861
So I had to achieve it for her

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:09.861
to make her proud of me.

00:12:10.621 --> 00:12:12.060
But she just told me

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.261
her biggest wish

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.900
is to hope

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.221
I live according to my own wishes.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.060
Jun An isn't attractive to you,

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.700
is it?

00:12:26.461 --> 00:12:27.080
It is.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.861
I really like Jun An.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.700
I like the people here too.

00:12:33.021 --> 00:12:34.540
Although I haven't won much,

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.300
at least I've won before.

00:12:38.221 --> 00:12:39.780
I'm confident. I'm not bad at this.

00:12:42.381 --> 00:12:43.940
But liking something is one thing.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.981
I truly don't know

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.981
if staying here as a lawyer

00:12:49.981 --> 00:12:52.101
is what I really want for my future.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.621
Also, I need

00:12:59.060 --> 00:12:59.981
to apologize to you.

00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:02.021
This is your case.

00:13:03.021 --> 00:13:04.060
The missing demand letter

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.981
must have caused
you significant trouble.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.780
You didn't say anything

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.060
because you didn't want to pressure us.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.261
But I can't pretend to be unaware.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.180
This is my job.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.900
I've apologized
to the client and resolved it.

00:13:20.221 --> 00:13:21.180
As the lead attorney,

00:13:21.621 --> 00:13:23.501
I'm responsible for the client.

00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.221
Precisely because it's your work,

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.180
I can't let you pay

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.420
for my mistake.

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:30.141
I'm responsible for this.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.480
Ms. Bai.

00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:39.261
My college mentor told me

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.341
that in actual law firm work,

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.820
it's truly harder for women
to get opportunities.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.221
(Women reaching your position)

00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:48.580
(must have given more
than male lawyers.)

00:13:50.101 --> 00:13:52.300
(They say law schools have
many female students now.)

00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:54.180
(But looking at law firms today,)

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.101
(female partners)

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.341
(are proportionally fewer than men.)

00:13:57.981 --> 00:13:58.981
(Are they incompetent?)

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:00.780
(No.)

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.381
(They're just in a harder position.)

00:14:04.861 --> 00:14:05.580
(So I cannot)

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.180
(let you take the blame for my mistake.)

00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:08.861
And I can't let Ren Jiatong,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.381
who'll likely become

00:14:10.381 --> 00:14:12.180
an outstanding female lawyer someday,

00:14:12.741 --> 00:14:13.981
be held back

00:14:14.461 --> 00:14:15.141
by what I did.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.141
My mistake is my mistake.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.060
I won't avoid it.

00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:23.461
Although I don't know

00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:25.060
what I'll enjoy doing in the future,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.580
one thing I know for sure

00:14:28.861 --> 00:14:30.621
is that I refuse
to become someone I hate.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.341
Li Ke,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.741
thank you for being honest
with me today.

00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:01.021
Li Ke.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.900
Why not make your final decision
after Mr. Song returns

00:15:04.021 --> 00:15:05.261
for the review meeting?

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.141
Didn't we agree you'd just see me off?

00:15:08.861 --> 00:15:09.420
We're worried

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.060
that it's an impulsive decision.

00:15:11.981 --> 00:15:12.580
No need.

00:15:13.141 --> 00:15:13.861
He's decided.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.360
Mr. Zhou.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.221
I know what you said to Ms. Bai.

00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:19.528
Well done.

00:15:20.381 --> 00:15:21.741
I'm not pretending to be noble

00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:23.300
or sacrificial.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:23.940
I am truly not.

00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:25.621
Besides taking responsibility,

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.101
I'm honestly exhausted.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.700
I don't know about you guys,

00:15:29.981 --> 00:15:31.261
but these past months,

00:15:31.981 --> 00:15:34.060
my hair's been thinning from stress.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.660
And I'm so tired

00:15:35.861 --> 00:15:36.981
that I've gained weight.

00:15:37.141 --> 00:15:37.700
Fatigue bloat.

00:15:37.981 --> 00:15:39.060
My pants are getting tight.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.501
When I first came,

00:15:40.501 --> 00:15:41.580
I loved socializing.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.741
Now, I'm so drained

00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:44.180
that I don't want to talk.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.900
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.300
Perhaps this is fate.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.741
Without your words,

00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:52.501
I wouldn't know whether this was my wish

00:15:52.621 --> 00:15:53.381
or my sister's.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.461
Take care then.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.060
I'm leaving.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.456
Li Ke.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.501
Whatever you do next,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.780
I'm here if you need help.

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:10.056
Absolutely.

00:16:10.741 --> 00:16:11.741
You are my own senior.

00:16:16.221 --> 00:16:16.840
Go for it.

00:16:19.501 --> 00:16:20.141
Keep fighting.

00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:36.900
Li Ke.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.381
You came specifically to see me off?

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.060
You can't leave like this.

00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:46.501
We haven't clarified it yet.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.101
I thought you'd be happy about staying.

00:16:50.461 --> 00:16:51.501
Of course I want to stay.

00:16:52.021 --> 00:16:52.900
But not like this.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.700
I drank that night.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.741
I can't recall where I put
the demand letter.

00:16:58.221 --> 00:16:59.540
So I'm partly responsible too.

00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:01.300
Don't go easy on me.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.021
I'm not going easy on you.

00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:04.380
I'm not that noble.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:05.860
Then why?

00:17:06.181 --> 00:17:08.140
Because I genuinely
remembered what happened.

00:17:09.181 --> 00:17:10.780
I was very hesitant

00:17:10.901 --> 00:17:11.981
about speaking up.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.540
I'm only human.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.421
I'm selfish too.

00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:15.901
It'd be a secret if unsaid.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:17.981
But we law students

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.140
have a duty to the truth, don't we?

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.820
Honestly, I've been exhausted lately.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.221
This situation

00:17:26.221 --> 00:17:27.540
gives me a dignified way out.

00:17:28.181 --> 00:17:28.701
That's fine.

00:17:30.741 --> 00:17:32.221
It's been two months since we met.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.941
Maybe we never became friends.

00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:37.181
But I'll remember
what you said that day.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.661
I know you meant every word.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.380
I was wrong.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.780
Not just us.

00:17:45.181 --> 00:17:46.300
Others want to stay too.

00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:47.741
Each has their reasons.

00:17:48.661 --> 00:17:49.981
I was just too afraid of losing

00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:51.380
and never considered how they felt.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.540
Like Yan Fei.

00:17:54.221 --> 00:17:55.860
She needs to prove
herself to her family.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.620
Jiang Chen wants
to escape his father's shadow.

00:17:59.421 --> 00:18:01.021
Guo Xiaoyu's ex-boyfriend has made her

00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:02.580
determined to make her mark in Beijing.

00:18:03.021 --> 00:18:03.701
Then Huang Yue.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.140
Before her marriage,

00:18:05.901 --> 00:18:07.620
she's searching for purpose.

00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:09.300
Let alone you.

00:18:09.741 --> 00:18:10.540
Only me.

00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:14.181
I alone didn't know what I truly wanted.

00:18:15.021 --> 00:18:16.461
My earlier competitiveness

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.181
was just to let my sister see me win,

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.300
so she'd be proud.

00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:21.820
I didn't want her to think

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.300
her years of investing in me

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.620
meant nothing

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.140
or that her own brother

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.181
wasn't good enough

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.540
and finally let her down.

00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:31.221
Anyway,

00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:33.580
we've come far together.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:34.952
Li Ke.

00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:37.461
Are you sure?

00:18:38.021 --> 00:18:38.661
Really leaving?

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.421
I'm a bit luckier than you.

00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:42.461
Ren Jiatong.

00:18:43.701 --> 00:18:44.701
Most of the time,

00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:46.300
many things

00:18:46.701 --> 00:18:48.060
aren't what we'd choose,

00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:49.820
but given by our families.

00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:51.540
So I think,

00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:53.741
don't shoulder family matters

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.340
as your personal burden.

00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:02.380
I... Don't be nervous.

00:19:03.221 --> 00:19:05.221
Just sharing my perspective casually.

00:19:05.661 --> 00:19:06.181
I'll leave.

00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:07.560
Li Ke.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.380
Whether you practice law or not,

00:19:12.941 --> 00:19:13.860
I can see

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.741
you genuinely love this profession.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.501
Thank you.

00:19:28.261 --> 00:19:30.741
I remember my first day at Jun An.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.021
You were the first one I met.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.181
Now, on my last day at Jun An,

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.421
you're the last to see me off.

00:19:40.661 --> 00:19:41.256
Good.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.461
Your future is bright.

00:19:53.701 --> 00:19:54.901
Till we meet again.

00:20:18.941 --> 00:20:19.540
The email came.

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:23.400
(Fifth Round Results)

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.168
(Dear interns: The fifth round is over.)

00:20:24.168 --> 00:20:25.032
(Many thanks for your dedication.)

00:20:25.192 --> 00:20:26.012
(Scoreboard of the Fifth Round)

00:20:26.012 --> 00:20:27.240
(Eliminated: Wang Lu)

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.104
(Eliminated: Huang Yue)

00:20:28.104 --> 00:20:29.096
(Eliminated: Li Ke)

00:20:29.096 --> 00:20:30.056
(1st Place: Jiang Chen,
Total Points: 125)

00:20:30.056 --> 00:20:31.016
(1st Place: Ren Jiatong,
Total Points: 125)

00:20:31.016 --> 00:20:31.816
(2nd Place: Yan Fei, Total Points: 120)

00:20:31.816 --> 00:20:32.808
(3rd Place: Guo Xiaoyu,
Total Points: 110)

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.520
Everyone.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.981
The fifth round

00:20:39.221 --> 00:20:40.421
ends today.

00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:41.981
Li Ke is eliminated.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.140
So in the email,

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.741
only the four of you received rankings.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.580
Two-thirds of the match have passed.

00:20:46.941 --> 00:20:48.380
Next, two more will be eliminated

00:20:48.741 --> 00:20:49.540
among you.

00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:51.688
Keep fighting.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:54.661
Mr. Zhou.

00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:55.701
So...

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:57.300
Now that Li Ke is gone,

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.100
do you need help with his workload?

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.160
Okay.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.300
Mr. Zhou, should we pick a new partner

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.140
for Ms. Bai's trip?

00:21:04.701 --> 00:21:05.820
I discussed it with Ms. Bai.

00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:07.340
The results will be sent to you.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.820
Ms. Bai, I also emailed you

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.221
to apply for the business trip.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.261
But you ultimately chose Ren Jiatong.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.620
May I ask why?

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.181
I'm just wondering.

00:21:27.261 --> 00:21:29.261
Do you consider me inferior to her?

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.181
You're this round's top performer.

00:21:31.221 --> 00:21:32.780
Is that answer important to you?

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.736
Yes.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.820
But opportunities matter more to me.

00:21:36.501 --> 00:21:38.421
Without delaying work progress,

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.501
I still want this assignment with you.

00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:42.060
And more opportunities later.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.981
Moreover, I've always believed

00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:45.221
among our group,

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.021
I possess every skill they have

00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:49.060
and additional skills they lack.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:50.661
Like what?

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.780
For example,
I can bring new possibilities

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.981
to Jun An's business.

00:21:55.701 --> 00:21:57.501
So you're here to keep
promoting yourself?

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.440
Yes.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.461
I love boxing.

00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:01.701
Someone once told me

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.261
the most compelling aspect of boxing is

00:22:04.501 --> 00:22:05.780
that unless the boxer gives up,

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.100
even at the final moment,

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.701
they still can fight for victory.

00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:10.501
When I first joined Jun An,

00:22:10.501 --> 00:22:11.820
maybe I wasn't that proactive.

00:22:12.021 --> 00:22:13.221
But I now understand

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.741
great lawyers need competitive drive.

00:22:16.421 --> 00:22:18.501
Well, it's not the final round yet.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:19.720
Ms. Bai.

00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:21.421
Do I have a chance?

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:24.421
Excellent.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.701
Few people barge into my office

00:22:28.021 --> 00:22:29.620
and demand opportunities this way.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.221
I admire boldness.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.340
But this case involves

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.100
a heavy workload.

00:22:35.221 --> 00:22:36.140
And tight deadlines.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.981
Ren Jiatong is more familiar

00:22:37.981 --> 00:22:39.100
with our team's operations.

00:22:39.501 --> 00:22:40.741
So my decision stands.

00:22:45.501 --> 00:22:46.120
I understand.

00:22:46.661 --> 00:22:47.300
I'll head out.

00:22:49.261 --> 00:22:50.060
Don't be upset.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.501
I see your potential.

00:22:53.941 --> 00:22:55.380
Remember what you just told me.

00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:56.340
Be a great boxer.

00:22:57.261 --> 00:22:57.800
Keep pushing.

00:22:59.021 --> 00:22:59.580
Thank you.

00:23:17.221 --> 00:23:17.832
Yan Fei.

00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:24.380
How do you know I'm here?

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.741
When you're upset,

00:23:25.741 --> 00:23:27.540
you like sitting in the car for a while.

00:23:27.741 --> 00:23:28.580
I've seen it before.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.661
What's up?

00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:34.701
I have a feeling.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.461
You may want to hit
the boxing gym today.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.540
Can I come too?

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.461
My resume hides an unusual skill.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.300
Number one punching bag
in Daxing District, Beijing.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.100
Master Zhou,
your prediction missed today.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.100
I'm not going to the gym.

00:23:48.701 --> 00:23:49.981
Whatever, just take me with you.

00:23:50.501 --> 00:23:51.461
It's rush hour.

00:23:53.261 --> 00:23:53.896
Alright.

00:23:54.941 --> 00:23:55.860
But one condition.

00:23:56.021 --> 00:23:56.820
No comforting me.

00:23:57.261 --> 00:23:57.928
No comfort.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.701
The stars here are stunning.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.580
You practically drove me back

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.021
to the suburbs where I grew up.

00:24:30.021 --> 00:24:31.300
I gotta show you something

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.501
you can't see in the CBD.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.661
Your childhood was quite charmed.

00:24:36.261 --> 00:24:36.981
Now, they are not

00:24:36.981 --> 00:24:38.181
as beautiful as I remember.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.380
But these stars in my heart

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.421
will never fade.

00:24:43.021 --> 00:24:43.624
See that one?

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.060
The brightest one.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.181
That's Venus.

00:24:47.021 --> 00:24:48.380
In my childhood astronomy club,

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:49.501
my teacher said

00:24:50.221 --> 00:24:52.060
Venus was the goddess

00:24:52.421 --> 00:24:53.461
of love and beauty.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.261
However dark the night,

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.221
with love and beauty in your eyes,

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.461
you could always see
Venus by looking up.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:00.941
I was impressed.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.701
So whenever life gets hard,

00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:04.820
I come up here

00:25:05.221 --> 00:25:05.860
and watch them.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.421
Very Kantian,

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.221
very therapeutic.

00:25:10.021 --> 00:25:12.300
But this isn't about Venus.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.941
What are you trying to say to me?

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.261
As we agreed today,

00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:15.860
no comforting.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.221
I'm not comforting you.

00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:18.820
This isn't a foul.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.580
Who is the Kant you mentioned?

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.181
Our colleague?

00:25:24.181 --> 00:25:25.461
Making me laugh is a foul.

00:25:25.981 --> 00:25:26.696
No teasing then.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.300
Ms. Bai praised me today.

00:25:32.261 --> 00:25:35.300
But it was that formal, textbook praise,

00:25:36.181 --> 00:25:37.860
which makes me feel

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.860
it's only because of
my family connections.

00:25:40.261 --> 00:25:41.501
Even Ms. Bai

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.181
keeps handling me

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.021
with kid gloves

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.421
and avoids crossing me.

00:25:47.461 --> 00:25:49.000
She's scolded Ren Jiatong.

00:25:49.661 --> 00:25:50.701
She'd never do that to me.

00:25:51.941 --> 00:25:53.701
Because for clever people like Ms. Bai,

00:25:53.701 --> 00:25:55.060
extra courtesy

00:25:55.461 --> 00:25:56.741
means you're kept at a distance.

00:26:00.181 --> 00:26:01.981
You either feel looked down on

00:26:01.981 --> 00:26:03.661
or excessively coddled.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.221
Do others fixate more
on your background,

00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:08.021
or do you fixate more on it yourself?

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.021
I can't just ignore it.

00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:14.340
Actually, I've long since realized

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.100
I'm like a game character

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.860
following preset algorithms,

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.820
where every step has to unfold

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.901
with rigid precision.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.060
When I was a kid, whatever happened,

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.181
my parents would say,

00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:27.901
"That's not for a girl

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.701
to worry about."

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.421
I couldn't learn

00:26:31.421 --> 00:26:33.380
rough sports like soccer or basketball.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.860
Only ballet was deemed suitable.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.941
Then growing up?

00:26:36.941 --> 00:26:39.741
Studying abroad meant finance, business,

00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:40.620
or law.

00:26:41.421 --> 00:26:43.340
Then gilding my resume
at Red Circle Firms

00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:46.221
before getting nepotically hired

00:26:46.221 --> 00:26:47.780
as our family company's Legal Director.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.741
Then marrying some family friend's son,

00:26:50.741 --> 00:26:52.981
popping out perfect kids

00:26:53.421 --> 00:26:54.860
whose lives follow

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:55.780
this same rigid script.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.140
I can't even complain about it.

00:26:59.501 --> 00:27:00.981
Because people would say,

00:27:00.981 --> 00:27:02.261
"She's so dramatic."

00:27:03.741 --> 00:27:04.661
Don't deny it.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.140
You think it too.

00:27:08.021 --> 00:27:09.620
But I really want to be a great lawyer.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.661
What I see

00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:14.981
is you getting closer to becoming one.

00:27:15.461 --> 00:27:16.181
You told me,

00:27:16.181 --> 00:27:17.860
"Since Ren Jiatong
and Li Ke are pending,

00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:18.620
I'll step up."

00:27:19.181 --> 00:27:20.181
Then you told Ms. Bai

00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:22.140
you bring unique advantages others lack.

00:27:22.701 --> 00:27:24.380
That shows you've fully grasped

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.421
what makes you formidable

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.340
and wielded it strategically.

00:27:28.221 --> 00:27:30.060
That's exactly

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.100
what excellent lawyers do.

00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:33.620
This isn't flattery.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.981
You really have good taste.

00:27:36.741 --> 00:27:37.860
Ms. Bai isn't placating you.

00:27:39.261 --> 00:27:40.661
She's the case lead.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.421
Her staffing choice

00:27:42.421 --> 00:27:44.140
isn't about raw talent.

00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:46.221
It's about tactical efficiency

00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:49.021
during this critical window.

00:27:50.221 --> 00:27:51.741
I know the theory.

00:27:51.741 --> 00:27:52.461
But I still...

00:27:52.461 --> 00:27:53.192
Resentment?

00:27:54.021 --> 00:27:55.340
Your current struggle proves

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.461
how well your family

00:27:56.461 --> 00:27:58.221
has shielded you.

00:27:58.901 --> 00:27:59.528
Yan Fei.

00:27:59.981 --> 00:28:00.901
If you trust me,

00:28:01.261 --> 00:28:03.580
and you want to be a good lawyer now,

00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:04.860
what you need to do

00:28:04.981 --> 00:28:07.021
is certainly not to question
how others see you,

00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:09.100
but to learn how to deal with

00:28:09.221 --> 00:28:10.741
times when things don't go your way.

00:28:11.261 --> 00:28:11.880
Like...

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.540
when a case isn't going well,

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.421
or when you need

00:28:15.421 --> 00:28:17.860
to find a way to calm
the upset client and gain their trust.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.820
When effort outweighs return,

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.421
or when the value of life
and your sense of justice

00:28:22.421 --> 00:28:23.340
aren't fulfilled.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:24.780
When you're too busy

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:25.941
and your family resents it.

00:28:25.941 --> 00:28:27.060
Just too many situations.

00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:29.261
Learn to deal with these moments,

00:28:30.221 --> 00:28:31.580
and you'll truly understand

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.140
the toughest parts of being a lawyer

00:28:33.741 --> 00:28:34.344
and how to get

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.421
one step closer to being a good lawyer.

00:28:39.701 --> 00:28:40.221
I promise

00:28:41.701 --> 00:28:42.312
when I'm back,

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.661
I'll be sure

00:28:43.661 --> 00:28:45.941
to share with you all the experiences

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:46.741
about the trial.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.536
Mr. Zhou,

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.421
you've been so kind to me.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.620
Do you like me?

00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:08.776
I...

00:29:10.941 --> 00:29:13.021
Well, of course, I like you.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.060
But it's the same
as how I feel about Li Ke,

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.221
Guo Xiaoyu, Jiang Chen, and the others.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.780
I-I know you're very responsible

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.580
and reliable,

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.421
but the things you've done for me

00:29:29.421 --> 00:29:31.780
have surely gone
beyond what a mentor should do.

00:29:36.701 --> 00:29:38.461
Maybe it's because when I see you all,

00:29:39.941 --> 00:29:42.100
it's like seeing my old self.

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:45.021
When I made mistakes,
felt lost and down,

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.780
I wanted someone to encourage me.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.021
So my kindness

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.100
to you is my way
of making up for that old me.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.501
Have you been studying
psychology recently?

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.421
It's late.

00:30:03.901 --> 00:30:04.540
Go home early.

00:30:05.181 --> 00:30:06.261
My home is nearby.

00:30:06.261 --> 00:30:06.941
I'll go myself.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.461
I'll drive you home.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.300
No, no, no need.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.820
I was just saying it casually.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.580
You don't have to.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.340
I just want to walk and watch the stars.

00:30:14.461 --> 00:30:15.540
Are you running away?

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.181
I'm not.

00:30:18.181 --> 00:30:19.340
Making me laugh is a foul.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.181
I'm not doing that.

00:30:20.901 --> 00:30:21.576
Drive safely.

00:30:57.083 --> 00:31:02.024
(Guo Xiaoyu typing: Mr. Song.)

00:31:04.616 --> 00:31:08.489
(Mentor, emergency backup needed.)

00:31:09.128 --> 00:31:11.237
(Could you send some work my way?)

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.312
(Urgent research case. Who's in?)

00:31:22.312 --> 00:31:23.484
(Me, me.)

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.513
(It's for Yiaiwan.)

00:31:40.261 --> 00:31:40.901
Hello, Mr. Song.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.421
Xiaoyu, it's like this.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.941
The project I just mentioned

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.620
is about an AI model

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.580
Yiaiwan is developing.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:49.981
Their legal department

00:31:49.981 --> 00:31:51.421
wants us to help avoid legal risks

00:31:51.421 --> 00:31:52.741
in the user agreement.

00:31:53.221 --> 00:31:54.181
I understand you.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.221
You want more points,

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.140
but you seem to lack
the experience in this area...

00:31:59.221 --> 00:32:00.620
Mr. Song, I understand.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.701
I don't have that much legal experience,

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.741
but I'm from Hangzhou,

00:32:04.981 --> 00:32:07.021
and I recently visited
Yiaiwan's headquarters.

00:32:07.421 --> 00:32:08.501
I feel like I might

00:32:08.501 --> 00:32:09.901
understand the company a bit better

00:32:09.901 --> 00:32:11.981
than my peers.

00:32:12.181 --> 00:32:13.620
Plus, I heard from Zhubao...

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.620
Zhu Zhisheng mentioned

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.100
he wrote code for this model.

00:32:17.288 --> 00:32:17.941
So,

00:32:17.941 --> 00:32:20.100
I might have a better understanding

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.380
of its basic logic.

00:32:21.608 --> 00:32:22.421
Also,

00:32:22.461 --> 00:32:23.340
in the past,

00:32:23.701 --> 00:32:25.181
during graphic and video production,

00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:26.461
I used many kinds

00:32:26.461 --> 00:32:27.181
of AI software.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:30.820
Mr. Song,

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.501
I really want this opportunity.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.780
I want to earn points for myself.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.860
I don't want to be last again.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.384
Alright,

00:32:41.741 --> 00:32:43.100
give it a try first.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.221
Offer a legal opinion
as soon as possible for me

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.060
to review.

00:32:47.701 --> 00:32:48.488
Okay?

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.461
Okay, thank you, Mr. Song.

00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:52.168
Come on.

00:33:35.931 --> 00:33:37.736
(Aunt)

00:33:46.261 --> 00:33:46.888
What?

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.421
Startled to see me sitting here?

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.100
Are you

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.060
avoiding me?

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.860
I know your concerns.

00:33:54.501 --> 00:33:56.380
The next round is two out of four.

00:33:57.021 --> 00:33:59.021
You worry if Yan Fei
wins the next round,

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:00.620
one of us will leave?

00:34:03.701 --> 00:34:04.981
I'm gonna tell Guo Xiaoyu

00:34:05.221 --> 00:34:06.501
you don't see her as a rival.

00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:10.461
With your trip tomorrow,

00:34:10.861 --> 00:34:11.901
why are you still here?

00:34:13.501 --> 00:34:15.140
To get familiar with the case files.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.140
Honestly, I'm fine.

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:17.901
Ms. Bai and Mr. Zhou have it tougher.

00:34:18.301 --> 00:34:20.421
They say they started
working right after arrival.

00:34:20.981 --> 00:34:21.672
Also,

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:22.901
I'm not avoiding you.

00:34:24.981 --> 00:34:26.421
You're gonna bring these materials?

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.620
Digital files are convenient,

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.381
but physical documents
are better in court.

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.060
When all case files are

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.821
logically organized right before you,

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.501
no matter what happens,

00:34:36.501 --> 00:34:37.620
you can handle anything.

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.060
I have full confidence in Ms. Bai,

00:34:41.021 --> 00:34:42.740
but over-preparing never hurts.

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.180
Besides, I've studied

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.341
Ms. Bai's trial recordings.

00:34:45.341 --> 00:34:46.620
She prefers physical copies.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.501
I even want to make a mind map.

00:34:51.341 --> 00:34:51.880
Tired?

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.501
Not at all.

00:34:54.341 --> 00:34:55.981
The financial scale
of this case is huge.

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.580
This is my first major case.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:00.821
Kinda exciting.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.060
People might think

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.821
you're some criminal mastermind.

00:35:07.341 --> 00:35:09.021
Getting thrilled
about litigation numbers?

00:35:11.021 --> 00:35:12.660
So you studied Ms. Bai's methods?

00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:13.580
How'd you do it?

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.861
She rarely takes me on a business trip.

00:35:18.901 --> 00:35:20.781
I must understand
my supervisor's preferences.

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.088
You?

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.260
Why not go back?

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.580
I just finished work.

00:35:28.341 --> 00:35:29.140
Here for some space.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:30.620
What's wrong?

00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:32.821
Nah.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:35.861
Do you know?

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.501
Your brows furrow every time you stress.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.220
Relax.

00:35:41.461 --> 00:35:42.120
Smile.

00:35:43.381 --> 00:35:44.620
Frowning causes creases.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.140
When I frowned as a kid, my dad would

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:52.140
do this.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.660
Tell me to smile.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:54.941
And I'd smile.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.140
I'm used to it.

00:36:00.301 --> 00:36:00.981
It works.

00:36:01.941 --> 00:36:02.504
Useful.

00:36:17.301 --> 00:36:18.981
You heard my stories last time.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.781
Can I hear yours?

00:36:21.501 --> 00:36:22.421
We had drinks.

00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:24.501
We have unlimited snacks.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.220
My mom...

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.461
She...

00:36:32.781 --> 00:36:33.821
learned that my dad and I

00:36:33.821 --> 00:36:35.700
met here once.

00:36:36.941 --> 00:36:38.140
Wanting me back in Chongqing.

00:36:39.381 --> 00:36:41.740
She's been contacting me nonstop lately.

00:36:42.981 --> 00:36:43.660
Way too often.

00:36:45.021 --> 00:36:45.740
Understandable.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:46.941
Your dad's offer

00:36:46.941 --> 00:36:47.461
is definitely

00:36:47.461 --> 00:36:48.580
better than Jun An's.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:50.260
What's this?

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.660
We're competing right now.

00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:53.180
Talking me out of the race?

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.540
Well then,

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.968
stay, and beat me.

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.580
I will definitely stay.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.580
That confident?

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.620
Yet afraid of her calls?

00:37:07.981 --> 00:37:08.781
Don't call me out.

00:37:15.821 --> 00:37:16.540
I...

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.861
I don't want to rely on my dad.

00:37:17.861 --> 00:37:18.941
I won't go to Chongqing.

00:37:19.901 --> 00:37:20.660
I don't want

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.301
my mom to feel upset either.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.381
I don't want to hurt either one.

00:37:24.381 --> 00:37:25.700
So for now, I'll avoid it.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.540
Maybe while I'm avoiding it,

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.861
the problem will solve itself.

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.580
Well said.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.421
Avoidance isn't shameful.

00:37:40.021 --> 00:37:40.540
And it works.

00:37:40.981 --> 00:37:42.740
From now on, tell any client:

00:37:43.301 --> 00:37:44.981
When trouble comes, avoid it first.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.901
Don't bother lawyers.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.981
If they must, go to Ren Jiatong.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.700
But never bother Mr. Jiang.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.100
No rambling.

00:37:54.341 --> 00:37:55.100

I'll handle it.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.180
What's so heavy?

00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:33.501
I learned you and Ms. Bai
worked nonstop for days.

00:38:33.501 --> 00:38:34.941
I wanted to help you,

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:36.100
so I printed

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.461
all the documents needed.

00:38:37.461 --> 00:38:39.140
They're organized
sequentially and bound.

00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:40.220
Okay.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:40.808
Thank you.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.312
Let's go.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.140
I'll do this.

00:38:44.381 --> 00:38:44.981
Ms. Tian's kid

00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:46.620
was hospitalized with acute pneumonia.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:47.660
Ms. Bai let her go home.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.421
We planned

00:38:48.421 --> 00:38:49.540
to get a fourth-year lawyer.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.220
But he's tied up with another case.

00:38:51.461 --> 00:38:52.136
No time.

00:38:52.461 --> 00:38:53.700
Ms. Bai said you assisted her

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.660
in the case's prep work.

00:38:54.821 --> 00:38:55.861
So you're reassigned.

00:38:55.861 --> 00:38:56.700
Only the three of us.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:58.861
I'm ready to start anytime.

00:38:59.301 --> 00:39:00.540
Good. Take an hour.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.620
Settle in and rest.

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.060
Then regroup in Ms. Bai's room.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.328
Got it.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.821
I just need to drop my bags.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.660
The first business trip

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.660
is new and exciting.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:09.941
I was the same.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.660
But I suggest

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.501
you get some rest.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.060
From now on, our sleep time

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.461
will be counted in minutes.

00:39:16.461 --> 00:39:17.540
Don't worry, Mr. Zhou.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:18.740
I'm good at staying up.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.580
Stocked up on coffee and Red Bull.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.620
It's only three days. No sleep needed.

00:39:22.981 --> 00:39:23.781
Alright.

00:39:23.781 --> 00:39:24.341
I'm here.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:25.960
Here.

00:39:28.381 --> 00:39:29.461
Five minutes is all I need.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.301
So many documents.

00:39:40.981 --> 00:39:42.421
I thought we'd prepared everything

00:39:42.421 --> 00:39:43.781
at the firm.

00:39:43.901 --> 00:39:44.861
These are bank records

00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:46.140

00:39:48.301 --> 00:39:49.301

Full account details.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.941
The court just granted
our review request.

00:39:54.781 --> 00:39:55.781
We finally got approval.

00:39:55.981 --> 00:39:57.301
We must comb through everything

00:39:57.301 --> 00:39:58.461
before the court.

00:39:58.901 --> 00:39:59.740
Look for any evidence

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.381
that supports our defense strategy.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.781
Select favorable evidence

for cross-examination

00:40:03.861 --> 00:40:05.220
and make charts and PPT

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:05.981
for the court.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:06.660
Well?

perfect court performances

00:40:13.941 --> 00:40:16.540
require unimaginable prep work.

00:40:16.901 --> 00:40:17.700
Even if you think

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.620
you're fully prepared,

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.381
unexpected challenges

00:40:21.381 --> 00:40:22.580
will always surface.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.032
Don't worry.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.341
We'll solve them.

00:40:28.981 --> 00:40:29.941
While organizing,

00:40:29.941 --> 00:40:31.461
remember our defense approach.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:32.501
Focus specifically

00:40:32.501 --> 00:40:33.981

00:40:33.981 --> 00:40:36.021
