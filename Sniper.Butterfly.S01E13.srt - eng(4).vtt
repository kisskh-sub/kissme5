(Taking medicine)

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.980
Hello.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:08.610
Mr. Lin from the restaurant
called me.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.130
He said recently

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.780
some seasonal spring vegetables
have arrived, like Malantou

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.850
and Tianqi.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.266
I thought we could take advantage
of the season

00:03:16.288 --> 00:03:17.333
and try some fresh dishes.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.610
You go try it first today.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.410
I won't go.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.850
What's wrong?

00:03:22.022 --> 00:03:23.380
Your voice doesn't sound right.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.850
I think I have a bit of a cold.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.540
My head feels a bit dizzy.

00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:28.850
The season is changing,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.290
and our hospital has been seeing

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.500
a lot of viral colds.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.540
Maybe the air conditioning
was too low yesterday.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.600
I caught a little chill.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.820
But it's okay.

00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:39.177
I've prepared the medicine.

00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:41.088
Just remember to eat something first.

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:42.577
Don't take medicine on an empty stomach.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.850
Got it, thanks.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.890
Dr. Lu.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.410
Mrs. Cen.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.170
Hello.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:05.910
Come on. I'll carry it for you.

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:07.220
No. I'll carry it myself.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.790
Give it to me.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.130
Thank you.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.820
What's this?

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.570
I brought some food for Cen Jin.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.690
You're too polite.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.850
Not at all.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.600
It's nothing.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.850
Mrs. Cen,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.460
you're carrying so much.
It must be heavy.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.220
Next time, just give a call.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.930
I'll buy it

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.155
and have it delivered.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.730
Jin likes to eat these oranges.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.340
She and her brother

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.220
live door to door.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.370
So I bought one for each.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.066
I bought a few more.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.140
Li Wu?

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.170
Yeah.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.170
You know him?

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.140
Met him a couple of days ago.

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:40.370
He's her cousin, right?

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.850
We and Wu

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.100
have no family relation.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.730
That's right.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.850
They are pretty close,

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.088
so I thought he was her cousin.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.100
And also,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.540
Cen Jin cares about him a lot.

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:54.290
They must have known each other
for a long time.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.730
They've known each other too long.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.490
This matter

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.340
is a bit complicated.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.850
At that time,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.900
my husband's company organized

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.290
a countryside excursion activity.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.250
Li Wu was just

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.290
a child he met back then.

00:05:08.244 --> 00:05:10.100
It's just that their family
had some changes,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.410
Jin did a good deed

00:05:11.555 --> 00:05:12.900
and brought him from his hometown

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.370
here to study.

00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:15.700
As they spent time together,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.355
they naturally became like siblings.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.900
Before,

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.700
why didn't Cen Jin ever mention it?

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.170
When Wu was a sophomore,

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.290
he was recommended
by the school to study abroad.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.460
These years,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.020
he has been

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.170
living alone abroad.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.020
But now he's back

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.955
and running his own company,
doing business.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.410
Honestly,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.170
my husband and I

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.250
like Wu so much.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.900
Dr. Lu.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.333
I digressed.

00:05:45.288 --> 00:05:47.730
My old friend and I planned
to do some beauty treatments.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.900
Now there's no time.

00:05:49.022 --> 00:05:50.950
You just happen
to be delivering something to Jin,

00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:52.050
so help me carry it up.

00:05:52.222 --> 00:05:52.850
I won't go up.

00:05:53.022 --> 00:05:54.222
Alright, no problem, Mrs. Cen.

00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:54.930
Alright.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.980
Thanks a lot.

00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:56.930
You're welcome. Bye.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.610
Bye.

00:06:25.111 --> 00:06:26.460
Why did you come all of a sudden?

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.444
Just to check on you.

00:06:27.466 --> 00:06:28.444
Is your cold bad?

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.460
It's okay.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.050
Come in.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.460
Okay.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.930
Why did you bring so much stuff?

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.950
The fruits were bought by Mrs. Cen.

00:06:42.955 --> 00:06:44.050
She had something come up.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.333
She met me downstairs
and asked me to bring them up.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.511
What a coincidence.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.600
I packed some porridge.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.410
Eat this first.

00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:53.711
If it doesn't work,
we'll go to the hospital.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.810
Thanks.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.000
You're welcome.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.850
Come in.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.580
Okay.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.170
We might need a bowl.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.020
Have you eaten?

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.888
Want to eat together?

00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:07.400
Sure.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.066
Do you have a spoon?

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.370
Yes.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.490
Here.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.800
You eat first.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.020
Thanks.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.610
Pretty tasty.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.644
It's nice, right?

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.220
That outfit looks familiar.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.333
It's Li Wu's, right?

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:11.930
Yes.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.140
Last night, his door lock broke,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.222
so he couldn't get in.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.780
He stayed at my place for the night.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.410
Actually...

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.290
I've been meaning to ask you

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:29.930
about Li Wu.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.250
Sometimes,

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.311
I feel you're not that close.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.180
But sometimes it feels like

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.610
you're very in sync.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.977
But don't overthink it.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.130
Honestly,

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.940
I just want to learn more.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.730
I don't want any

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.600
miscommunication between us.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.060
We're not biological siblings.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.010
Yesterday is history.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.370
Tomorrow is a mystery.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.250
But today is a gift.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.940
That's why

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.650
it's called the present.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:40.980
The present.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.370
Are you talking about the gift
or the present?

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.180
The present.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.420
You're right.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.250
Future treatments

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.250
will be adjusted

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.940
to be more targeted.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.610
They're just minor issues.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.370
No need to worry.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.850
It just takes time to manage.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.890
If he can

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:10.940
change his lifestyle,

00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:12.288
and take medicines on time,

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:13.460
he will improve.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.130
Thanks.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.130
You're welcome.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.490
Mr. Li.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.000
Why can't we follow the plan I proposed?

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:37.940
Your plan

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.700
uses a hard-coded approach,

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.250
forcing this vulnerability

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.022
to be suppressed.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.420
It doesn't solve the problem,

00:10:43.444 --> 00:10:44.700
and it makes the vulnerability

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.490
more complicated.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:48.940
If you plant this trap now,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.700
it'll take more time later

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.770
to fix the issue.

00:10:52.022 --> 00:10:53.460
But time is tight and tasks are heavy.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.180
I consider it a temporary solution.

00:10:55.866 --> 00:10:58.288
Can you take responsibility
for your temporary solution?

00:10:58.333 --> 00:10:58.888
I...

00:10:59.420 --> 00:10:59.940
Li Wu.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:02.755
Talking business?

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.250
Okay. I'll come over later.

00:11:04.511 --> 00:11:05.010
It's okay.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:05.977
Wait for me a moment.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.530
Chenyang.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.755
I know recently
everyone's been working hard.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:17.610
You too.

00:11:18.533 --> 00:11:20.090
We just need to get through this period,

00:11:20.111 --> 00:11:20.888
and it'll be fine.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.940
You're the boss.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.311
Of course, we follow your lead.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.250
Li Wu.

00:11:32.466 --> 00:11:33.909
Here's the contract from Mr. Qin.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.340
I just had legal department review it.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:35.980
No issues.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:36.770
Take a look.

00:11:37.644 --> 00:11:38.700
Once Cheng Rui returns,

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.088
we should sign it quickly.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.940
I've been thinking over
the past few days.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.010
I feel

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.820
I still can't accept

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.490
Mr. Qin's terms.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.010
What do you mean?

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.060
Do you still remember

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.490
what we said when we first

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.466
started Tongchen?

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.610
We wanted to constantly

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.460
pursue advanced technology.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.650
And leave our mark

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.890
in the industry.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.180
That was then.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.060
We were too idealistic back then.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.650
Right?

00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:23.733
Okay, I understand.

00:12:23.733 --> 00:12:24.377
I get it.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.933
You want to make great technology.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:26.850
Great technology

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.130
requires more funding.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.490
We should get more investment.

00:12:31.533 --> 00:12:33.066
Commercializing the company quickly

00:12:33.066 --> 00:12:34.060
is the most efficient.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.340
Yes, I understand.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.133
I also know
that we're running a company.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:38.700
I'm not

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.980
purely idealistic.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:41.850
But technology

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.650
is our foundation.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:47.300
Look.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.100
See.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.420
Mr. Qin not only interferes

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.490
with our development plans,

00:12:59.010 --> 00:12:59.700
but also sets

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.180
such harsh profit conditions.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.490
This is capital.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.460
Capital seeks profit.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.980
Right now, the AI industry

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.650
is booming.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.300
A lot of hot money is pouring in.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.490
Investments are coming to us.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:11.850
I...

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.700
Don't rush.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.650
We can't refuse it.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:15.180
Don't rush.

00:13:18.777 --> 00:13:19.340
How about this?

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.644
Wait for Cheng Rui to return,
then we can talk it through.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.890
Li Wu, listen to me.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:25.370
Mr. Li.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.060
A runtime vulnerability appeared.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.460
I need you to take a look.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.511
Okay, I'll go immediately.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.180
You go ahead.

00:13:36.222 --> 00:13:37.990
We'll find another time
to have a proper talk.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.488
I have something urgent
over there.

00:13:39.488 --> 00:13:40.400
I need to go handle it.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:40.850
Okay.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.650
This scent is kind of magical.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.266
What is this? Smells so good.

00:13:55.288 --> 00:13:56.444
Jin, come.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.533
Sit.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.010
A company called Rumeng

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.940
sent us a batch
of aromatherapy products.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.377
They're interested in cooperating.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:02.890
Jin.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:03.770
Smell this.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.820
New sleep aid aroma.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.220
It's designed to calm urban anxiety

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.200
and relieve insomnia.

00:14:08.266 --> 00:14:09.610
Abroad, it's a popular brand.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:10.890
Recently,

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.555
they might want to
enter the Chinese market.

00:14:12.555 --> 00:14:13.420
So they approached us

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.555
for a full campaign.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.340
It smells good.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.244
But does it really help us sleep?

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.340
I actually don't really believe.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.770
These so-called effects

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.890
are usually just a scam.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.010
David.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.420
You're bold.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.200
Daring to question the future client.

00:14:32.244 --> 00:14:33.511
Isn't Jun still negotiating?

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.022
And it's not finalized yet, right?

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.730
It's settled.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.940
Someone from Rumeng called me just now.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:39.770
They said

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.250
after reviewing our past cases,

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.730
they're quite confident in us.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:43.700
Then,

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.420
we discussed some

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.460
details about cooperation.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.650
So,

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.700
the initial cooperation
is already confirmed.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:51.444
How about it?

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.220
This project

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.130
will be handled by you.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:56.730
How about this?

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.340
Everyone goes back and tries it.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.600
Next week, we'll have a meeting

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.511
to discuss our experience
after using it.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:02.300
Okay.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.288
- Alright.
- Fine.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.580
Thanks to our client for the meal.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.890
I'll make sure to try it properly

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.850
to prove it's not a scam.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.790
It really smells amazing.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:12.650
Jun.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.180
About this aromatherapy's

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.100
claimed effects,

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.130
did the client

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.300
provide any information?

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.610
They gave

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:19.580
an English version.

00:15:19.644 --> 00:15:21.100
Once the Chinese version is ready,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:21.911
I'll send it to you.

00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:24.130
English version is fine, too.
Send it to me first.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.466
I want to understand it first.

00:15:25.488 --> 00:15:26.820
Especially regarding

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.220
relieving insomnia and anxiety.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.700
So dedicated.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.377
I think that's a selling point.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.300
Alright.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.770
What's up?

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.177
The door lock is broken again?

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.820
Nothing.

00:16:08.444 --> 00:16:09.488
Working overtime again?

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.180
Sister.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.610
Well...

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.820
Tonight,

00:16:30.577 --> 00:16:32.044
I've been so busy working overtime.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.530
I didn't eat anything.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.580
My stomach isn't feeling great.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.580
The delivery took too long.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.940
At home,

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.770
there's nothing to eat either.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.955
I'll just have some noodles.

00:16:51.688 --> 00:16:52.666
I'll leave after eating,

00:16:52.688 --> 00:16:54.022
and won't stay a second longer.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:57.890
Come in.

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:08.490
Take a seat.

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.355
It'll be quick.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.220
Why so many aromatherapy products
at your place?

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.777
I just took on
an aromatherapy ad project.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:29.730
Their new series is sleep-aid focused.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:36.330
By the way,

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.010
you have insomnia, right?

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.570
Do you want to try

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:40.290
using it?

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.911
How do I try it?

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.050
Just put it on your bedside
before sleep,

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.700
and drop a few drops of essential oil.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:49.460
Do you have

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.730
a sleep monitoring app?

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.222
No.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.644
I'll download one for you.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:56.900
It can monitor

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.700
your sleep onset

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.730
and sleep quality

00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:59.755
to see if it improves.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.220
How long does it usually measure?

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.330
About a week.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:07.980
One week.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.380
A one-week period

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.050
provides too small a sample size

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.290
for analyzing results.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.460
Are all science majors like this?

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.377
Alright then.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.460
I'll prepare a trial report

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.400
and send it to you.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.050
Okay.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.490
Looks like I found the right person.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.810
By the way,

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.730
how have you been sleeping lately?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.380
Any headaches?

00:18:39.688 --> 00:18:41.977
Have you been taking your medicine
on time recently?

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.700
Sleep is a bit better than before.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:52.940
That's good.

00:18:53.511 --> 00:18:54.288
By the way,

00:18:54.311 --> 00:18:56.000
don't forget your follow-up
in a few days.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.177
Are you translating the materials?

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:27.460
Yes.

00:19:27.555 --> 00:19:29.377
They only have the English version
for now.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.700
Looks pretty troublesome.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:33.980
Can I take a look?

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:36.290
Sure.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.180
Looks like it works pretty well.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.330
This project is definitely doable.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.260
(Building Dreams for NCEE)
(Go for it, youth!)

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.420
(I finished my exam.)

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.377
(I finished my exam.)

00:24:49.977 --> 00:24:51.044
(Sister: How was it?)

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:54.810
Not bad.

00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:02.780
(Sister: When you remove
the first character,)

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.010
(I'll be satisfied.)

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:11.700
(Okay.)

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.330
Hello.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.770
This answer

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.380
is replying to my first line,

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.420
or the second line?

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.290
Both.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:31.700
As you said.

00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:35.311
Are you on vacation?

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:35.980
Yes.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.090
But, next week,

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.580
I still have to pick up my transcript.

00:25:39.822 --> 00:25:41.090
Okay. I'll pick you up later.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.940
Okay.

00:25:58.577 --> 00:25:59.980
I know what you're thinking.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:00.770
I'll go.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.530
You tidy up yourself,

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:03.466
and take a shower.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.290
It's not that messy.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:16.700
Not bad.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.570
See, it's all tidied up.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.330
Hello, Chun Chang.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.250
I just got home.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.730
A bit tired.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.220
Why aren't you dressed?

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.600
Where are your clothes?

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.090
I, um...

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.090
I took the wrong clothes
after showering.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:02.730
Then quickly put them on.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.250
Who isn't dressed?

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.822
Not wearing what clothes?

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.460
Wait, another man?

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.140
There's no man.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:24.940
It's Li Wu.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.644
He just got back from vacation.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.088
He forgot to put on a top
after showering.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.133
I just happened to see him
in the living room.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.700
How's Li Wu's figure?

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.490
Good body?

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.490
No way.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:39.620
Can you be serious?

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.180
Alright.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.488
That's all. I'm hanging up.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.730
Bye.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:48.380
Li Wu.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.730
Put on your clothes and come out.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.660
You left your towel outside.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.010
Got dressed?

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:24.822
Quick, dry your hair.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.620
Quick, dry it.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:47.530
Yes.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.288
By the way...

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.810
Any plans for the holiday?

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.900
I might be a bit busy.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.090
If needed,

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:58.810
I can take you

00:29:58.810 --> 00:29:59.733
to my parents' place.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:01.250
It's fine.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:02.330
No need.

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:04.050
Alright.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:08.380
It's cold.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.666
Easy to catch a cold.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.050
Wear more.

00:30:12.333 --> 00:30:13.466
Colds don't heal easily.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.400
Okay.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.140
By the way, Sister...

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.140
I want to go back to Yunfeng.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.290
Yunfeng?

00:30:52.088 --> 00:30:53.460
Are you visiting your aunt first?

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:56.980
My aunt said my uncle is back,

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.733
and told me not to go back yet.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.050
So this Chinese New Year,

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.570
are you staying here

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:04.490
or coming with me?

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:09.810
With you.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:11.810
Wise choice.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.980
Will you come with me?

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.290
Or you wait in the car first.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.010
Am I your driver?

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:26.250
Lead the way.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:14.140
(The Tomb of Deceased Grandfather,
Li Minghe)

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:18.800
I'm going to kowtow to grandpa.

00:32:20.022 --> 00:32:21.533
Do I need to turn around?

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:22.980
It's fine.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:23.460
No need.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:02.860
Done.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:23.380
Do I need to do anything?

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:24.860
No.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.700
Let's go.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:28.940
Wait.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:34.900
Grandpa,

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.860
Li Wu is well taken care of now,

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.380
and his grades are excellent.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.460
Rest assured over there.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:43.444
I will take good care of him.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.180
Let's go.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.820
(The Tomb of Deceased Grandfather,
Li Minghe)

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.377
What are you looking at?

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.690
My grandpa's home.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:26.555
You've been there.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.900
But now you can't see it.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.900
I'll go back and print out
that group photo

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.610
for you.

00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:47.170
Okay.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.340
Why did it get dark so fast?

00:35:03.688 --> 00:35:05.222
It's like that in the mountains.

00:35:06.822 --> 00:35:08.533
Quick, turn on the flashlight.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.130
What's that?

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.170
Probably a weasel.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:25.210
This...

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:28.860
Don't leave me

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.066
more than ten centimeters.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.380

you came back alone.

00:36:30.422 --> 00:36:31.333
Aren't you afraid?

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:32.690
Not afraid.

that the stars here are so beautiful.

Maybe...

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.170
they were hidden before.

Let's go home

00:37:24.955 --> 00:37:26.355
for the Chinese New Year.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:33.740
Come in.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.900
Ms. Xu.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:39.170
Li Wu.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.090
Congratulations.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:43.050
First in class for the final exam.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.090
(Li Wu)
Since you came to school,

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.066
(Class rank 1, Grade rank 31)
you've made rapid progress in studies.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.010
This time,

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:51.610
except for English listening, which you

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.740
need to review during the holiday,

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:55.980
other subjects performed well.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:57.740
So next semester,

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.570
I plan to put you in the Rocket Class.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:02.940
Make a final push with them.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:04.066
What do you think?

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.050
Sorry, Ms. Xu.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:06.900
What did you just say?

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:08.980
Going to Rocket Class.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:10.650
Rocket Class?

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:12.340
Amazing.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:14.650
It's recognition

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:16.530
of your ability to get into
a top university.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.570
You got first in the class so fast.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.340
If I were the teacher,

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.577
I'd think highly of you too.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.050
Actually, it's not that great.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.260
I just missed the top 30 in the school.

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:30.610
By only one place.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:31.780
That's already impressive.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:32.860
I'm telling you two,

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.222
it's Chinese New Year now.

00:38:34.222 --> 00:38:35.610
Can you talk about something happy?

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.900
Not scores

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:37.610
or exams.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.090
Relax a bit.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.980
This is something to be happy about.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:42.980
Oh my.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:44.260
This...

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:47.130
Are these dumplings?

00:38:47.755 --> 00:38:49.210
If you don't know, don't make them.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:50.690
Stop messing around.
Look at Wu.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:52.022
He made them beautifully.

00:38:52.044 --> 00:38:53.490
They are almost the same.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.200
Once it's in your stomach,
it's the same.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.530
Right?

00:38:59.050 --> 00:38:59.530
Yes.

00:38:59.911 --> 00:39:01.000
Don't agree casually.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:02.555
Don't just favor your sister.

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:04.460
She is good at everything,

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.090
except this strong-willed streak

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:06.740
is unbearable.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.420
It's quite good.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.260
See, it's a strength.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:12.610
Now you have a point.

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:21.690
It's pretty good.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.050
Wu.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.369
This is your first time

00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:59.911
celebrating Chinese New Year
at our home.

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.260
Do you want a drink too?

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:02.210
No, no.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:03.610
Not any hard liquor.

00:40:04.311 --> 00:40:05.200
NCEE is coming soon.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.550
You have to be careful in every way.

00:40:06.555 --> 00:40:07.260
Jin. Here.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:08.380
Pour the juice.

00:40:09.644 --> 00:40:10.490
I'll do it myself.

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:11.900
My status in this family

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.780
is getting lower and lower.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:16.860
Here.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:18.300
Thanks.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:25.650
Do you want

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:26.780
to say a few words?

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.570
Here I go.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:30.820
Right here...

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:35.490
Happy Chinese New Year
to Mom and Dad.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.690
I hope Mom is invincible
at the card table

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:38.860
next year,

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.210
and Dad,

00:40:40.466 --> 00:40:42.244
may your drinking capacity improve.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.260
Finally, I wish you

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.210
wealth and prosperity!
Give me the red envelope.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.300
- Good.
- Good.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.010
- Here.
- Time to give out red envelopes.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:48.460
Here.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:49.610
Thanks, Dad.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:50.940
Happy Chinese New Year.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:51.780
Thanks, Mom.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:54.260
Next year, don't cause me
too much trouble.

00:40:55.222 --> 00:40:56.222
Why are you spacing out?

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.530
Say some auspicious words.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.555
The sweeter your words,
the thicker the red envelope.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:02.570
Well...

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:03.530
Um...

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.820
Wish Mr. Cen and Mrs. Cen

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.777
a Happy Chinese New Year.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.300
Stay healthy and safe.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.050
- Good.
- Good.

00:41:13.311 --> 00:41:14.820
Good, you get a red envelope too.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.690
Why is his envelope so thick?

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:17.980
He just said

00:41:18.222 --> 00:41:20.170
Happy Chinese New Year,
stay healthy and safe.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:20.940
Eight characters.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:22.740
This is my red envelope.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:24.650
I give it to whoever I want.

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:25.900
As much as I want.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.111
You can't control that.

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:27.460
Here.

00:41:27.488 --> 00:41:28.533
Thanks, Mr. Cen, Mrs. Cen.

00:41:28.533 --> 00:41:29.844
You don't need to give me one.

00:41:29.866 --> 00:41:30.377
Um...

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.090
Wu.

00:41:31.844 --> 00:41:33.480
This is a Chinese New Year red envelope.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:34.644
You really don't want it?

00:41:34.666 --> 00:41:36.420
If you really don't want it,
I won't give it.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.740
Take it, silly.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.666
Hurry up and take it.
Or they won't give it.

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:41.900
Thanks, Mr. Cen.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:42.777
Thanks, Mrs. Cen.

00:41:43.555 --> 00:41:43.940
Alright.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:44.460
Sit down.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.010
Sit.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:45.530
Just sit.

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:46.822
- Here, raise your glass.
- Sit.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.900
Wu.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:50.940
If you have any difficulties

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.377
in studies and in life,

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:53.690
never keep them to yourself.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:54.980
Tell your sister, Jin.

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:57.300
Now, study well,

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:58.740
and get into a good university.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.050
Then, during holidays, come to

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.420
our place with Jin.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:04.610
Look at this.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:05.820
So lively,

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.690
like one family.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:07.610
How nice.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.460
Right?

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.420
Alright.

00:42:10.733 --> 00:42:11.688
Raise your glass.

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.177
- Thanks, Mr. Cen.
- Okay, here.

00:42:13.244 --> 00:42:13.733
Here.

00:42:13.777 --> 00:42:15.820
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.610
Cheers.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.644
Let's start.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:24.260
Mom, hurry up.

00:42:24.533 --> 00:42:25.711
Eat the dumplings first.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.740
Have one.

00:42:26.888 --> 00:42:29.422
- The dumplings I made must be nice.
- Dumplings for Chinese New Year.

00:42:29.422 --> 00:42:29.866
Here.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:31.130
Here.

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:31.530
Dad.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:32.740
You should have one too.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.380
Okay.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.050
Mom, you try too.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.050
